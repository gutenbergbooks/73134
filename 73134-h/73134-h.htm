<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lake Shore Series</span>, of which this book is the first
volume, includes six stories, whose locality and principal
characters are nearly the same, and which were originally
published in Oliver Optic’s Magazine, Our Boys and Girls.
The railroad, which is the basis of the incidents in the first
and second volumes, was suggested by the experience of
several young gentlemen in Ohio, who had formed a company,
and transacted all the business of a railroad in regular
form, for the purpose of obtaining a practical knowledge of
the details of such a corporation. They issued certificates of
shares, bonds, with interest coupons, elected officers, and
appointed all the employees required for the management of
a well-ordered railroad. The author is the fortunate possessor
of one of the bonds of this company—“The Miami Valley
Railroad.”</p>

<p>The young engineer is doubtless a smart boy; but so far as
his mechanical skill is concerned, several counterparts of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
have come to the knowledge of the writer. If he has an
“old head,” he has a young heart, which he endeavors to
keep pure and true. As he appears in this and the subsequent
volumes of the series, the author is willing to commend
him as an example of the moral and Christian hero,
who cannot lead his imitators astray; for he loves truth and
goodness, and is willing to forgive and serve his enemies.</p>

<hr class='r5'>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='chap-title'>MR. WADDIE WIMPLETON.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop—six pops.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie Wimpleton, an elegant young
gentleman of fifteen, by all odds the nicest young
man in Centreport, was firing at a mark with a revolver.
It was a very beautiful revolver, too, silver-mounted,
richly chased, and highly polished in all its
parts, discharging six shots at each revolution, not
often at the target, in the unskilful hands of Mr. Waddie,
but sometimes near enough to indicate what the
marksman was shooting at.</p>

<p>Even the target was quite an elaborate affair; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
though Mr. Waddie had been shooting at it for a
week, it was hardly damaged by the trial to which it
had been subjected. It was two feet in diameter,
having in its centre a tolerably correct resemblance
of one of the optics of a bovine masculine; and this
enigma, being literally interpreted, meant the bull’s
eye, which Mr. Waddie was expected to hit, or at least
to try to hit. Around it were several circles in black,
red, yellow, green, and blue, each indicating a certain
distance from the objective point of the shooter.
There were a few holes in the target within these
circles, but the central eye was not put out, and still
glared defiance at the ambitious marksman.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie Wimpleton had everything he wanted,
and therefore never wanted anything he had. There
was no end to the ponies, sail-boats, row-boats, guns,
pistols, fishing-rods, and other sporting gear, which
came into his possession, and of which he soon became
weary. His father was as rich as an East-Indian
prince, and Mr. Waddie being an only son, though
there were two daughters who partially “put his
nose out of joint,” his paternal parent had labored
industriously to spoil the child from babyhood. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
forced to acknowledge that he succeeded even better
than he intended.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie was always waiting and watching for a
new sensation. A magnificent kite, of party-colored
silk, had evidently occupied his attention during the
earlier hours of the morning, and it now lay neglected
on the ground, the line stretched off in the direction
of the lake. The young gentleman had become tired
of the plaything, and when I approached him he was
blazing away at the target with the revolver, at the
rate of six shots in three seconds. I halted at a respectful
distance from the marksman. He was not
shooting at me, but I regarded this as the very
reason why he would be likely to hit me. If he had
been aiming at me, I should have approached him
with more confidence.</p>

<p>Keeping well in the rear of the young gentleman, I
came within hailing distance of him. I did not belong
to the “upper-ten” of Centreport, and I could
not be said to be familiarly acquainted with him.
My father was the engineer in his father’s steam-flouring
mills, and a person of my humble connections
was of no account in his estimation. But I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
forced to confess that I had not that awe and respect
for Mr. Waddie which wealth and a lofty social
position demand of the humble classes. I had the
audacity to approach the young scion of an influential
house; and it was audacious, considered in
reference to his pistol, if not to his social position.</p>

<p>Pop, pop, pop, went the revolver again, as I placed
myself about five rods in his rear, feeling tolerably
safe in this position. When he had fired the three
shots, he stopped and looked at me. I could not
help noticing that his face wore an unusual aspect.
Though he was at play, engaged in what would have
been exceedingly exciting sport to a boy of my
simple tastes, he did not appear to enjoy it. To be
entirely candid, he looked ugly, and seemed to have
no interest whatever in his game.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie Wimpleton could not only look ugly,
but he could be ugly—as ugly as sin itself. Only
the day before he had been concerned in an awful
row on board of a canal boat, which lay at the pier
a dozen rods from the spot where he was shooting.
The boat had brought down a load of coal for the
use of the steam mill, and, having discharged her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
cargo, was waiting till a fleet should be gathered of
sufficient numbers to employ a small steamer to tow
them up the lake. Mr. Waddie had gone on board.
The owner’s family, according to the custom, lived
in the cabin, and the young gentleman had employed
his leisure moments in teasing the skipper’s
daughter, a pretty and spirited girl of his own age.
She answered his taunting speech with so much vim
that Mr. Waddie got mad, and absolutely insulted
her, using language which no gentleman would use in
the presence of a female.</p>

<p>At this point her father interfered, and reproved
the nice young man so sharply, and withal so justly,
that Waddie’s wrath turned from the daughter to the
parent, and in his anger he picked up a piece of
coal and hurled it at the honest skipper’s head. The
latter, being the independent owner and master of
the canal boat, and also an American citizen with
certain unalienable rights, dodged the missile, and
resented the impudence by seizing the young scion
of an influential house by the collar of his coat, and
after giving him a thorough shaking, much to the
discomfiture of his purple and fine linen, threw him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
on the pier, very much as a Scotch terrier disposes
of a rat after he has sufficiently mauled him.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie was not accustomed to this sort of
treatment. Whatever he did in Centreport, and especially
about his father’s estate and the steam mills,
no one thought of opposing him. If he set any one’s
shed on fire, shot anybody’s cow, or did other mischief,
the only remedy was to carry a bill of damages
to the young gentleman’s father; and then, though
the claim was for double the value of the cow or the
shed, the fond parent paid it without murmuring.
No one had ever thought of taking satisfaction for
injuries by laying violent hands on the scion.</p>

<p>But the worthy captain of the canal boat, though
he knew Colonel Wimpleton very well, had not
learned to appraise an insult to him or his family in
dollars and cents. The “young rascal,” as he profanely
called the young gentleman, had insulted his
daughter, had used vile and unbecoming language to
her, and, if he had had a cowhide in his hand at the
time, he would have used it unmercifully upon the
soft skin of the dainty scion. He had no weapon
but in his strong arms. Mr. Waddie had been made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to feel the weight of his muscle, and to see more
stars than often twinkled over the tranquil surface of
Lake Ucayga.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if the indignant skipper of the canal boat
had known Mr. Waddie better, he would have been
disposed to moderate his wrath, and to have chosen
a less objectionable mode of chastising his victim;
though on this point I am not clear, for he was
an American citizen, and an unprovoked insult to
his daughter was more than he could patiently
endure.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie struck the pier on his “beam ends.”
I beg to inform my readers that I am a fresh-water
sailor, and from the force of habit sometimes indulge
in salt expressions. In the rapid evolutions which he
had been compelled to make under the energetic treatment
of the stalwart skipper, his ideas were considerably
“mixed.” His body had performed so many
unwonted and involuntary gyrations, that his muscles
and limbs had been twisted into an aching condition.
Besides, he struck the planks, whereof the pier was
composed, so heavily, that the shock jounced from his
body almost all the breath which had not been expended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
in the gust of passion preceding the final
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The scion lay on the pier like a branch detached
from the parent tree; for if he realized anything in
that moment of defeat and disaster, it was that not
even his father’s influence had, on this occasion, saved
him from deserved retribution. He must have felt
for the instant like one alone in the world. Mr. Waddie
was ugly, as I have before suggested. The dose
which had just been administered to him needed to be
repeated many times, in order to effect a radical cure
of his besetting sin. He was well punished, but unfortunately
his antecedents had not been such as to
prepare him for the remedial agency. It did him no
good.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie lay upon the pier roaring like a bull.
According to the legends of his childhood, some one
ought to come and pick him up; some one ought
to appear and mollify his rage, by promising summary
vengeance upon the “naughty man” who had
upset his philosophy, and almost riven his joints
asunder. But no one came. His father and mother
were not within the hearing of his voice—no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
but myself and the irate skipper and his family.
The young gentleman lay on the pier and roared.
All the traditions of the past were falsified, for no
one came to his aid. I did not consider it my duty
to meddle, under the circumstances, and the skipper
would sooner have shaken him again than undone
the good deed he had accomplished.</p>

<p>As no one came to comfort him, Mr. Waddie
roared till he was tired of roaring—till the breath
came back to his body, and the full measure of
ugliness came back to his mind. He got up. He
walked down to the side of the canal boat, where
the honest captain was sitting composedly on his
stool. Mr. Waddie stormed furiously; Mr. Waddie
even swore violently. Mr. Waddie inquired, in heated
terms, if the honest skipper knew who he was.</p>

<p>The honest skipper did not care who he was. He
was an “unlicked cub.” No man or boy should
insult his “darter” without as heavy a thrashing as
he felt able to give him; and if the young gentleman
gave him any more “sarse,” he would just step
ashore and dip him a few times in the lake, just by
way of cooling his heated blood, and giving him a
lesson in good manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Waddie had already tasted the quality of the
skipper’s muscle, and he slowly retreated from the
pier; but as he went, he vowed vengeance upon the
author of his disaster. As he passed the spot where
I was stopping a leak in an old skiff belonging to
my father, he repeated his threats, and I felt confident
at the time that Mr. Waddie intended to annihilate
the honest skipper at the first convenient
opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='chap-title'>A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>Mr. Waddie fired three shots from his revolver,
and then turned to look at me; and
he looked ugly.</p>

<p>My father’s house was near the spot. I had been
planting peas in the garden all the morning, and I
had observed that the young gentleman was unusually
steadfast in his occupations. He had raised
his kite, and kept it up for half an hour. Then he
had fastened the string to the target, and “run it
down.” Occasionally I glanced at him to see what
he was about. After he had brought the kite down,
I saw him bringing it up to the target. Then he
went on board of the canal boat at the pier. The
honest skipper had locked up the cabin, and gone
with his family to visit his relations at Ruoara, eight
miles below Centreport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Waddie appeared to be making himself at
home on board. He went down into the hold, and
remained there a considerable time. After the savage
threats I had heard him make the day before,
it would not have surprised me to see the flames
rising from the honest skipper’s craft; but nothing
of this kind had yet occurred, though I was fully
satisfied that the scion was plotting mischief. After
he had been on board half an hour, he returned to
the target and popped away a while at it, though,
as I have before observed, he did not seem to take
any particular interest in the amusement.</p>

<p>On this day the flour mills were not at work,
having suspended operations to put in a new boiler.
After everything was ready for it the boiler did not
arrive, and all hands were obliged to take a vacation,
to await its coming. The mill was, therefore,
deserted, and my father had a little time to attend
to his own affairs. He was going down to Ucayga,
at the foot of the lake, upon business, which I shall
have occasion to explain by and by. He had gone
up to the town, and as he had given me permission
to go with him, I was to meet him at the steamboat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
landing. I was on my way to this point when I
paused to observe Mr. Waddie’s shooting.</p>

<p>A revolver is a very pretty toy for a boy of fifteen.
My father would as soon have thought of
giving me a live rattlesnake for a pet, as a pistol
for a plaything. At the same time, I understood
and appreciated the instrument, and should have
been proud and happy as the possessor of it. Mr.
Waddie, in one of his gracious moments, had permitted
me to fire this pistol, and I flattered myself
that I could handle it much better than he. He
never did anything well, and therefore he did not
shoot well. As I stood there, at a respectful distance,
admiring the splendid weapon, I envied him
the fun which might be got out of it, though I
was very sure he did not make the most of it.</p>

<p>He suspended his operations, and looked at me.
I hoped he was going to give me an invitation to
shoot; and I felt that, if he did, I could soon spoil
the enigmatical eye that glared at the shooter from
the target.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Wolf?” said he.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not necessary for me to explain that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
I was not actually a wolf; but it is necessary for
me to say that this savage appellation was the name
by which I was usually known and called in Centreport.
My father’s name was Ralph Penniman,
and at the time I was born he lived on the banks
of the Hudson. He had taken such a strong fancy
for some of the creations of Washington Irving, that
he insisted, in spite of an earnest protest on the
part of my mother, upon calling me Wolfert, after
one of the distinguished author’s well-known characters,
who obtained a great deal of money where
he least expected to find it. In vain my mother
pleaded that the only possible nickname—in a land
where nicknames were as inevitable as the baby’s
teeth—would be Wolf. My father continued to
insist, having no particular objection to the odious
name. I was called Wolfert, and I shall be Wolf
as long as I live,—perhaps after I die, if the width
of my tomb-stone compels the lapidary to abbreviate
my name.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Wolf?” asked Mr. Waddie
in a surly tone, which led me to think that I was
an intruder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing,” I replied; and knowing how easy it
was to get up a quarrel with the scion, I began to
move on.</p>

<p>“Come here; I want you,” added Mr. Waddie,
in a tone which seemed to leave no alternative but
obedience.</p>

<p>“I can’t. I have to go to the steamboat wharf,”
I ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>“Oh, come here—will you? I won’t keep you
but a minute.”</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie was almost invariably imperious; but
now he used a coaxing tone, which I could not
resist. I could not help seeing that there was something
about him which was strange and unnatural—a
forced expression and manner, that it bothered
me to explain. If the young gentleman was engaged
in any mischief, he was sufficiently accustomed
to it to do without any of the embarrassment
which distinguished his present demeanor. But I
could not see anything wrong, and he did not appear
to be engaged in any conspiracy against the
canal boat, or the honest skipper in command of
it. Appearances, however, are often delusive, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
they could hardly be otherwise when Mr. Waddie
attempted to look amiable and conciliatory.</p>

<p>“You are a good fellow, Wolf,” he added.</p>

<p>I knew that before, and the intelligence was no
news to me; yet the condescension of the scion was
marvellous in the extreme, and I wondered what
was going to happen, quite sure that something
extraordinary was about to transpire.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me, Waddie?” I asked,
curiously.</p>

<p>“I’m going up to the steamboat wharf, and I want
you to help me wind up my kite-line,” he added,
bustling about as though he meant what he said.</p>

<p>“How came your kite-line over there when your
kite is up here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I untied it, and brought it up here so as not
to tear the kite—that’s all. Take hold of the
string and pull it in.”</p>

<p>I picked up the line. As I did so, Mr. Waddie
gave a kind of a start, and held his elbow up at the
side of his head. But I did not pull on the line,
for, to tell the honest truth, I was afraid he was up
to some trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you haul it in, you fool?” demanded
Waddie, with more excitement than the occasion
seemed to require.</p>

<p>“I can’t stop to wind it up, Waddie; I’m in a
hurry. My father is waiting for me up at the wharf.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take but a couple of minutes; pull in,
and I’ll give you three shots with this revolver,” he
added.</p>

<p>“I can’t stay to fire the shots now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can! Come, pull in, and don’t be all
day about it,” continued he, impatiently.</p>

<p>I was almost sure he was up to some trick; he
was earnest and excited. The longer I stayed, the
worse it would be for me, and I dropped the string.</p>

<p>“Pick it up again!” shouted Waddie; and at the
same moment he fired off the pistol.</p>

<p>I did pick it up; for though the pistol ball did
not come very near me, I heard it whistle through
the air, and as I had never been under fire, I am
willing to confess that it frightened me. I do not
think Waddie meant to hit me when he fired, but
this consciousness made me all the more fearful for
my own safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p>“Now, pull in, you ninny! If you don’t mind
when your betters speak to you, I’ll put one of
these bullets into you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to kill me, Waddie?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, not if you mind what I say to you.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you my father is waiting for me at
the steamboat wharf.”</p>

<p>“No matter if he is; he’s paid for waiting when
I want you. Why don’t you pull in?”</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly why I did not pull in. He
threatened to shoot me, on the one hand, if I didn’t
pull in, and I felt as though something would happen,
on the other hand, if I did pull in. It was not improbable
to me, just then, that the young scion had
planted a torpedo in the ground, which was to be
touched off by pulling the string, and which was to
send me flying up into the air. I would have given
something handsome, at that moment, for ten rods
of space between me and the imperative young
scion at my side.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pull?” yelled he, out of patience
with me at last.</p>

<p>Springing forward, he grasped the string which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
then held in my hand, and gave it a smart jerk, at
the same time pointing the revolver at my head, as
if to prevent my sudden departure. The pulling of
the kite-string more than realized my expectations.
The very earth was shaken beneath me, and the
lake trembled under the shock that followed. High
in air, from the pier, a dozen rods distant, rose, in
ten thousand fragments, the canal boat of the honest
skipper. By some trickery, which I could not understand,
the gaily-painted craft had been blown up
by the pulling of that kite-string.</p>

<p>I could not see through it; in fact, I was so
utterly confounded by the noise, smoke, and dust
of the explosion, that I did not try to see through
it. I was amazed and confused, bewildered and
paralyzed. The fragments of the boat had been
scattered in a shower upon us, but none of them
were large enough to do us any serious injury.</p>

<p>My first thought was a sentiment of admiration
at the diabolical ingenuity of Mr. Waddie. It was
clear enough now that this was the revenge of the
young gentleman upon the skipper for the punishment
he had inflicted upon him. By some contrivance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
not yet explained, the young reprobate had
ignited a quantity of powder, placed in the hold of
the boat, with the kite-line. The honest skipper
seemed to be the victim now.</p>

<p>“Now see what you have done!” exclaimed Mr.
Waddie, when he, as well as I, had in some measure
recovered from the shock.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it,” I replied, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, you fool! Didn’t you pull the
string?”</p>

<p>“Not much! You pulled it yourself,” I protested.</p>

<p>“At any rate, we are both of us in a very sweet
scrape.”</p>

<p>“I’m not in it; I didn’t know anything about it,
and I’m not going to stay here any longer,” I
retorted, moving off.</p>

<p>“Stop, Wolf!”</p>

<p>He pointed the pistol at me again. I had had
about enough of this sort of thing, and I walked
back to him.</p>

<p>“Now, Wolf, if you want to”—</p>

<p>I did not wait for him to say any more. Choosing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
my time, I sprang upon him, wrested the pistol
from his grasp, threw him over backwards, and
made good my retreat to a grove near the spot,
just as the people were hurrying down to ascertain
the cause of the explosion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>WOLF’S FATHER.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>The grove into which I had retreated was on
the border of Colonel Wimpleton’s estate, and
in its friendly covert I made my way to the road
which led to the steamboat wharf. I put the pistol
into my breast pocket, intending, of course, to give
it back to Waddie when I saw him again. Just then
I heard the whistle of the steamer, and hastened to
the pier.</p>

<p>I was now far enough away from the scene of the
explosion to be out of the reach of suspicious circumstances,
and I had an opportunity to consider
my relations to the startling event which had just
transpired. I could not make up my mind whether
Mr. Waddie had been afraid to pull the string which
was to produce the blow-up, or whether he wished to
implicate me in the affair. If he had not been utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
wanting in all the principles of boy-honor, I should
not have suspected him of the latter. I could not
attribute his conduct to a lack of brute courage, for
he had finally pulled the string, though it was in my
hands at the time he did so. But it was of no great
consequence what his motives were. I had taken
no part in the blowing up of the honest skipper’s
boat, and did not know what the programme was
until the explosion came off. I felt that I was all
right, therefore, especially as I had escaped from the
spot without being seen by any one.</p>

<p>After the catastrophe had occurred, Waddie had
rudely asked me to see what I had done. I had
taken the trouble to deny my own personal agency
in the affair, but he had finally insisted that I pulled
the string. This indicated a purpose on his part. I
was in some manner mixed up in the matter; but,
as I had no grudge against the honest skipper, I
could not see why any person should be willing to
believe Waddie, even if he did declare that I was
engaged in the mischief. But above and beyond all
other considerations, I felt that I was not guilty,
and it was not proper that an honest young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
like me should bother his head about contingencies,
and situations, and suspicions. It was enough to be
free from guilt, and I was content to let the appearances
take care of themselves.</p>

<p>I found my father on the pier when I arrived.
He was dressed in his best clothes, and looked like
the solid, substantial man that he was. He could
not very well be genteel in his appearance, for the
smoke and oil of his occupation clung to him, even
when he wore his holiday suit. I have noticed that
men of his calling—and my own for some years—find
it almost if not quite impossible to get rid of a
certain professional aspect which clings to them. I
have almost always been able to tell an engineer
when I see one. There is something in the calling
which goes with the man wherever he goes.</p>

<p>Though my father was not, and could not be, genteel,
I was not ashamed of him. On the contrary,
I was very proud of him, and proud of the professional
aspect he wore. His look and manner had a
savor of engines and machinery, which I tried to
obtain for myself. When I was going to have any
new clothes, I always insisted that they should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
blue, because my father never wore any other color;
and I used to think, though I had not yet been thoroughly
steeped in oil and smoke, that I was not very
unlike an engineer.</p>

<p>Having acknowledged the possession of this pride
of occupation, I ought to explain where I got it.
It was not a mere vanity with me, for I desired to
look like an engineer because I was one. My father
and mother had been good parents to me, and had
proper notions in regard to my present and future
welfare. I was sixteen years old, and had been at
school all the time, summer and winter, until the
spring of the year in which my story opens. I do
not like to be egotistical, but I must say—since
there is no one else to say it for me—that I was
considered a very good scholar. I had just graduated
at the Wimpleton Institute, where I had
taken a high rank. I had particularly distinguished
myself in natural philosophy and chemistry, because
these studies were nearer to my heart than any
other.</p>

<p>I was my father’s only boy, and he had always
manifested a peculiar interest in me. Even before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
I was old enough to go to school, while we lived
on the banks of the Hudson, my father was in the
habit of taking me into the engine-room with him.
I used to ask him hundreds of childish questions
about the machinery, whose answers I was not old
enough to understand; but, as I grew in years and
mental power, the questions were repeated, and so
carefully explained, that, before I ever read a description
of the steam-engine, I had a very tolerable
idea of the principles upon which it was constructed,
and knew its mechanical structure.</p>

<p>When I was old enough to read and understand
books, the steam-engine became the study of my
life. I not only studied its philosophy in school,
but my father had quite a little library of books
relating to the subject, which I had read a great
many times, and whose contents I had considered
with the utmost care. A large portion of my spare
time was spent in the engine-room at the mills. I
had even run the machine for a week when my
father was sick.</p>

<p>I had gone farther than this in the study of my
favorite theme. As an engineer, my father was well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
acquainted with all of the men of the same calling
in the steamboats on the lake, and with some of
them on the locomotives which ran on the railroad
through Ucayga, at the foot of the lake. When our
family paid a visit to our former residence on the
Hudson, I rode on the engine all the way, and made
a practical study of the locomotive. I flattered myself
I could run the machine as well as the best of
them. Christy Holgate was the engineer of the
steamer now coming up to the pier, and under his
instruction I had mastered the mysteries of the
marine engine, with which I was already acquainted
in theory, after much study of the subject in the
books.</p>

<p>I did not pretend to know anything but the
steam-engine, and I thought I understood that
pretty well. My father thought so too, which very
much strengthened my confidence in my own ability.
I am sorry I have not some one else to tell my
story for me, for it is very disagreeable to feel
obliged to say so much about myself. I hope my
friends will not think ill of me on this account, for
they will see that I can’t help saying it, for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
story would seem monstrously impossible without this
explanation.</p>

<p>“Wolf, what was that noise down by the mill,
a little while ago?” asked my father, as I joined
him at the wharf.</p>

<p>“The canal boat at the mill pier was blown up,”
I replied, with some embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Blown up!” exclaimed he.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“They were blowing rocks back of the mill, and
I thought they must have set off a seam-blast; but
the noise did not seem to be in the direction of the
quarry. I don’t see how the canal boat could have
blown up. It wasn’t the water that blew her up.
Do you know anything about it, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I know a good deal more about it than
I wish I did,” I answered, for my father had always
been fair and square with me, and I should as soon
have thought of cutting off my own nose as telling
him a falsehood.</p>

<p>“What do you know, Wolf?” he asked, with a
look which betokened a rather painful interest in the
nature of the answer. “I hope there wan’t any mischief
about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>“It was all mischief.”</p>

<p>“Who did it? Not you, I hope.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I did not know anything about it till
the boat blew up. Waddie Wimpleton did it.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did,” said my father, nodding his
head significantly. “Did you see him do it?”</p>

<p>In reply I told the whole story, after we had
gone on board of the steamer, giving every particular
as minutely as though I had been a witness
in a murder trial.</p>

<p>“I heard Waddie had had a row with the captain
of the canal boat,” added my father, who seemed
to be vexed and disturbed more than I thought the
occasion required, as he could not but see that I
had no guilty knowledge of the conspiracy. “The
young rascal must have stolen the powder to be
used for blasting. Well, his father can pay the
damages, as he has done a hundred times before;
and I suppose it will be all right then.”</p>

<p>We went into the engine-room, and took seats
with Christy Holgate, who manifested no little interest
in the affair of the morning.</p>

<p>“The little villain intends to have you mixed up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in the scrape somehow, Wolf,” continued my father,
who could not turn his attention from the subject.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he does. I didn’t do anything,
and I’m willing to face the music,” I replied, confidently.
“I took his pistol away from him to keep
him from shooting me; but I mean to give it back
to him as soon as we return.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will be all right, Wolf,” said my father,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Your boy ain’t to blame, Ralph,” added Christy,
the engineer.</p>

<p>“I know he isn’t; but Colonel Wimpleton is the
worst man to get along with in the world when
Waddie gets into a scrape with other boys. He
thinks the little villain is an angel, and if he ever
does any mischief he is led away by bad boys.
Well, no matter; I am glad this thing takes place
to-day instead of last week.”</p>

<p>“Why so, father?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what I am going up to Ucayga
for, this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I haven’t heard.”</p>

<p>“Well, I talked it over long enough with your
mother this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>“I wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Wolf,” replied my father, throwing
one leg over the other, and looking particularly well
satisfied with himself and all the rest of mankind.
“When we first went to Centreport, I bought the
place we live on of Colonel Wimpleton. I gave
him one thousand down, and a note, secured by
mortgage, for two thousand more. I think the
place, to-day, is worth four thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“All of that,” added Christy.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been saving up all my spare money
ever since to pay off that mortgage, which expires
next week. I have got the whole amount, and four
hundred dollars more, in the bank at Ucayga, and
I’m going to take it out to-day, and pay up. That’s
what’s the matter, Wolf; but I don’t quite like this
row with Waddie.”</p>

<p>Christy listened with quite as much interest as I
did to the story of my father.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>ON THE LOCOMOTIVE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>After we had sufficiently discussed the explosion
and my father’s financial affairs, Christy
Holgate took from under the seat where he sat
a curiously-shaped black bottle and a tumbler. I
would rather have seen him take a living rattlesnake
from the box, and place it at my feet—or rather at
my father’s feet, for it was on his account that I
shuddered when I heard the owner of the bottle declare
that it contained “old rye whiskey.” Christy
told a tedious story about the contents of this “vial
of wrath”—where it was distilled in the State of
Kentucky; how a particular friend of his had procured
two quarts of it, and no more of that year’s
manufacture could be had in the whole nation, either
for love or for money.</p>

<p>One would have supposed, from the eloquent description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
of its virtues, that it was the nectar of the
gods, instead of the fiery fluid which men put into
their mouths to take their brains away. I was disgusted
with the description, and I shuddered the
more when I saw that my father was interested in
it, and that he cast longing glances at the queer-shaped
bottle. I had heard that my father lost his
situation at the town on the Hudson by drinking to
excess, and I trembled lest the old appetite should be
revived in him. If he had been a man like Christy
Holgate I should not have trembled, as I viewed
the case, for he <ins id='c043' title='original: had drank'>had drunk</ins> liquor all his lifetime to
moderation, and no one had ever known him to
be intoxicated. It was not so with my father. He
had struggled manfully against the insidious appetite,
and, with only a couple of exceptions, he had
always done so successfully. Twice, and twice only,
had he been under the influence of liquor since he
came to Centreport. I feared, if he tasted the contents
of the strange-looking bottle, that the third
time would have to be added to the list.</p>

<p>Christy poured out a glass of the “old rye” and
my father drank it. The engineer of the boat took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
one himself; and both of them talked very fast then
till the steamer arrived at her destination. I was
alarmed for my father’s safety, and I tried to induce
him to go on shore the moment we reached the
wharf; but before we could leave Christy produced
the bottle again, and both of them took a second
dram, though I noticed that the engineer took a
very light one himself.</p>

<p>The effect upon my father was soon apparent,
though he did not appear to be actually intoxicated.
He did not stagger, but he talked in a loud and
reckless manner. He gave me a dollar, and told me
to spend it for anything I wanted. He said it was
a holiday, and he wished me to have a good time.
I put the dollar in my pocket, but I did not leave
my father. I was mortified by his blustering speech
and extravagant manner, but I still clung to him.
I hoped my presence would prevent him from taking
another dram; and I think it did; for though,
on our way to the bank, we passed several bar-rooms,
he did not offer to enter one of them. Two
or three times he hinted to me that I had better
go and enjoy myself alone, which assured me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
he desired to drink again, but did not wish to do
so before me.</p>

<p>I have since learned that a man will always be
more circumspect before his children than when
away from them. He feels his responsibility at
such times, and is unwilling to degrade himself
before those who are his natural dependents. I told
my father I had no place to go to, that I did not
wish to buy anything, and that I preferred to remain
with him. He was vexed at my obstinacy, but
he did not say anything. We went to the bank
together, and he drew out his money, twenty-four
hundred dollars—more than he had ever possessed
at one time before. It would discharge the mortgage
on the place, and leave him four hundred
dollars to make certain improvements which he contemplated.</p>

<p>The whiskey which he <ins id='c045' title='original: had drank'>had drunk</ins> made him feel
rich, and it pained me to see him manifest his feelings
in a very ridiculous way. He put the money
in a great leather pocket-book he carried, and placed
it in his breast pocket. By various little devices I
induced him to return to the steamer with me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
When it was too late I was sorry I had done so,
for Christy Holgate again placed the bottle to his
lips, taking hardly a teaspoonful of its contents
himself. It would be an hour before the train arrived,
whose passengers the steamer was to convey
up the lake, and I trembled for the safety of my
father and of the large sum of money he had in
his pocket.</p>

<p>It seems very strange to me, and I dare say it
has seemed so to others, that some men, when they
have the greatest work of their lifetime in hand,
or are pressed down by the heaviest responsibility
that ever weighed upon them, choose this very time
to get intoxicated. My father had certainly done
so. With more than two thirds of his worldly
wealth in his pocket, he had taken to drinking
whiskey—a thing he had not done before for at
least a year. Half of the hour we had to wait
had passed away, and my poor father made himself
very ridiculous. I had never felt so bad before in
my life.</p>

<p>“Wolf, my boy, I forgot to get my tobacco when
I was up in town,” said he, handing me a quarter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
“Run up to that store next to the hotel, and get
me half a pound of his best plug.”</p>

<p>I did not want to leave him, but I could not
disobey without making a terrible scene. I went as
fast as my legs would carry me, and returned out of
breath with running. My father <ins id='c047' title='original: had drank'>had drunk</ins> nothing
during my absence, and I was startled when I beheld
his changed appearance on my return. He was
deadly pale, and was trembling with emotion. He
was searching his pockets, and gazing nervously into
every hole and corner in the engine-room, where I
found him.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, father?” I asked, alarmed
at his appearance.</p>

<p>“I have lost my pocket-book, Wolf,” gasped he,
in an awful and impressive whisper.</p>

<p>“Lost it!” I exclaimed, almost paralyzed by the
intelligence.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Ralph!” added Christy, with a forced
laugh. “You can’t have lost it, if you had it when
you came here.”</p>

<p>“I did have it; I know I did. I felt it in my
pocket after I came on board.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Then it must be in your pocket now. You
haven’t been out of the engine-room since you
came,” persisted Christy.</p>

<p>I helped my father search his pockets; but the
pocket-book was certainly gone.</p>

<p>“You must have dropped it out on your way
down from the bank,” said the engineer.</p>

<p>“How could I drop it out?” groaned my father,
as he pointed to the deep pocket in which he always
kept it.</p>

<p>I searched again in every part of my father’s
clothing, but in vain. He was perfectly sober now,
so far as I could judge, the grief and mortification
attending his heavy loss having neutralized the effects
of the liquor. On the seat stood the queer-shaped
bottle from which my father had imbibed
confusion. By its side was the tumbler, half filled
with the whiskey. I concluded that it had been
poured out for my father, and that the discovery
of his loss had prevented him from drinking it. I
put them on the floor and looked into the box; I
examined every part of the engine-room again, but
without success. The missing treasure could not be
found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<p>My father sat down upon the box again, and
actually wept for grief and shame. I heard the
whistle of the approaching train. It seemed to
startle the victim of the whiskey bottle from his sad
revery. He removed his hands from his face, and
glanced at Christy, with a look which was full of
meaning to me, and seemed to be quite intelligible
to the engineer.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll take a look on the wharf,” said
Christy, beginning to edge slowly out of the engine-room.</p>

<p>“Christy Holgate,” cried my father, springing at
the throat of the engineer, and clutching him like a
madman, “you have got my money!”</p>

<p>“Why, Ralph, what ails you? Do you think I’d
take your money?” replied Christy; but his face
was as pale as my father’s and his lip quivered.</p>

<p>“I know you have! That’s what you made me
drunk for,” continued my father savagely, as he began
to claw into the garments of the engineer, in
<ins id="c049" title='original: seach'>search</ins> of his treasure.</p>

<p>Christy started as though he had been stung by
a serpent when my father placed his hand upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
breast pocket, and a violent struggle ensued. As
my maddened parent tore open his coat, I distinctly
saw enough of the well-known pocket-book to enable
me to identify it. He had taken it from my father’s
pocket and transferred it to his own while handing
him the glass of whiskey.</p>

<p>“He has it, father!” I shouted. “I see it in his
pocket.”</p>

<p>Christy was a powerful man, and with a desperate
effort he shook off my father, hurling him upon
the floor with much violence. Having shaken off
his fierce assailant, he rushed from the engine-room
to the gang-plank forward, by which the passengers
were coming on board, and disappeared in the
crowd. Without waiting to learn the condition of
my father, I followed him. I lost sight of him in
the throng, but I commenced an earnest search for
him. Presently I discovered him skulking along by
the train on the side opposite that at which the
passengers were getting out.</p>

<p>The engine had been detached from the train,
and had moved forward to the water tank to have
her tender filled. The engineer had left the locomotive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to speak with a friend on the wharf; and
the fireman, after the tender was filled, helped the
men throw in the wood. I went ahead of the engine,
where I could observe the movements of Christy.
I thought he would hide till the train started, and
then jump on board. If he did, I meant to be a
passenger on the same train.</p>

<p>The tender was filled with wood, and the men
walked away, including the fireman. The moment
they had gone, Christy sneaked along by the woodsheds,
and jumped upon the locomotive. He could
not see me, for I was concealed by the smoke-stack.
He started the engine. I jumped upon the cow-catcher.
In a moment, as he let on the steam, the
locomotive was flying like lightning over the rails.
I clung to the cow-catcher till the motion was steady,
and then climbed up to the side of the machine,
exhibiting myself to the astonished villain. At this
moment, I happened to think of Waddie’s revolver
in my pocket. It was a useful plaything for an emergency
like this, and I drew it forth.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>CHRISTY HOLGATE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>“Stop her!” I shouted again and again to
Christy Holgate, as I pointed the pistol at
his head through the window of the cab.</p>

<p>When I first made my appearance, he had thrust
his head and shoulders through the window, apparently
to examine the situation, and determine in
what manner he could best dispose of me. I threatened
to shoot him, and he drew in his head, placing
himself where I could not see him without changing
my position.</p>

<p>I pointed the pistol at Christy and threatened to
fire; but I had as little taste for shooting a man as
I had for eating him, and I beg the privilege of
adding, that I am not a cannibal. I found it very
easy to talk about firing, but very much harder to
do it. Christy had proved that he was a villain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and a very mean villain too; but I found it quite
impossible to carry my threat into execution. I
could reason it out that he deserved to be shot, and
as he was running away with my father’s money,
and did not stop the engine when I told him to
do so, that it would be perfectly right for me to
shoot him.</p>

<p>If I had been a bloodthirsty, brutal monster, instead
of an ordinary boy of sixteen, with human feelings,
I suppose I could have fired the pistol while
the muzzle covered the head of the rascal in the
cab. If I had not been afraid of killing him, I
think I should have fired; for I had considerable
confidence in my skill as a marksman, though it had
not been fortified by much practical experience.</p>

<p>Though Christy had been very useful in enabling
me to enlarge my knowledge of the mysteries of
the marine engine, and though I was reasonably
grateful to him for the privilege he had afforded
me, I did not feel under great obligations to him.
Whenever I made a trip with him in the engine-room,
for the purpose of studying my favorite theme,
he invariably set me at work upon some dirty job,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
either at oiling the machinery or cleaning the bright
parts. He was rather stout, and it was always my
function to climb up and oil the gudgeons and other
working parts of the walking-beam. I had done
almost everything pertaining to an engine, under his
direction. He used to praise me without stint, and
call me a smart boy; which perhaps he intended as
my reward, though I found it in the knowledge and
experience I had gained.</p>

<p>I did not refrain from pressing the trigger of the
revolver while aiming it at Christy’s head on account
of the debt of obligation which weighed me down.
I knew enough about an engine to make myself
useful, and I worked hard for all the information I
obtained. Still I considered myself indebted to him
for the opportunities he had afforded me; and, if he
had not chosen to be a villain, I am quite sure I
should always have felt grateful to him, even while
I paid in hard work for every scrap of knowledge I
obtained from him.</p>

<p>Christy and my father were quite intimate; though,
as the steamer in which he served always lay nights
and Sundays at the lower end of the lake, they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
not been together much of late years. He had recommended
my father for the position he then held
in the flour mills. I know that my father felt under
great obligations to him for the kind words he had
spoken in his favor, and had often urged me to help
him all I could, encouraging me by the hope that
I might, by and by, get a place as engineer on a
steamboat.</p>

<p>The engineer of the Ruoara—for this was the
name of the steamer in which we had gone down
to Ucayga—was a strange man in some respects.
He made a great deal of the service he had rendered
to my father and to me, and very little of the
service we had rendered to him, for my father had
often made him little presents, often lent him money,
and had once, when the mills were not working, run
his steamer for him a week, while he was sick, without
any compensation. I never thought Christy had
any cause to complain of either of us. But I dislike
this balancing of mutual obligations, and only do it
in self-defence; for it is the kindness of the heart,
and the real willingness to do another a favor, which
constitute the obligation, rather than what is actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
done. “And if ye do good to them that do good
to you, what thank have ye? For sinners also do
even the same.”</p>

<p>Christy was a man who always believed that the
world was using him hardly. He was unlucky, in
his own estimation. The world never gave him his
due, and everybody seemed to get the better of him.
Though he had good wages, he was not worth any
money. He spent his earnings as fast as he got
them; not in dissipation, that I am aware of, but
he had a thriftless way of doing business. He never
could get rid of the suspicion that the world in general
was cheating him; and for this reason he had
an old grudge against the world. On the passage to
Ucayga he discoursed in his favorite strain with my
father when he learned his errand. The unhappy
man seemed to think that it was unjust to him for
one in the same calling to have twenty-four hundred
dollars in cash, while he had not a dollar
beyond his wages.</p>

<p>The engineer of the steamer had not pluck enough
to resent and resist injustice. Perhaps he thought
that, in introducing my father to his situation, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
had been the making of him, and that he was therefore
entitled to the lion’s share of his savings for
five years. Whatever he thought, he had deliberately
formed his plan to rob my father of his money,
and had actually succeeded in his purpose. Christy
knew the weak point of his intended victim, and
had plied him with whiskey till he was in a situation
to be operated upon with impunity. I think
my father wanted to drink again, and had sent me
for the tobacco so that I should not see him do so.</p>

<p>My father afterwards told me that he recalled the
movements of Christy when he took the pocket-book
from him, though he thought nothing of them at
the time.</p>

<p>“Ralph, you are a good fellow—the best fellow
out! Let’s take one more drink,” said Christy, as
reported by my father.</p>

<p>“I’m a good fellow, Christy, and you’re another,”
replied the victim. “Just one more drink;” and my
father, in his maudlin affection for his friend, had
thrown his arms around his neck, and hugged him.</p>

<p>During this inebriated embrace Christy had taken
the money from his pocket. After he had poured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
out the liquor, he found that his pocket-book was
gone. The discovery paralyzed him; but his head
was too much muddled at first to permit him to
reason on the circumstances. He remembered that he
had felt the pocket-book only a few minutes before;
and, as soon as he could think, he was satisfied that
his companion had robbed him, for the simple reason
that no one else had been near him. He was ashamed
of his own conduct. He was conscious that he <ins id='c058' title='original: had drank'>had
drunk</ins> too much, and that this had been the occasion
of his misfortune.</p>

<p>I do not know what Christy’s plan was, or how
he expected to escape the consequences of his crime.
He had easily shaken my father off, and made his
escape. However hardly the world had used him, he
was certainly more severe upon himself than his
tyrant had ever been; for when a man commits a
crime, he treats himself worse than any other man
can treat him. I could not fathom the villain’s
plan in running away with the locomotive. I
doubt whether he had any purpose except to escape
from immediate peril, and thus secure his ill-gotten
prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>The circumstances had devolved upon me the
responsibility of capturing the treacherous friend.
Half a dozen times I threatened to shoot him if he
did not stop the engine, but somehow my muscles
did not seem to have the power to execute the
threat. Christy had placed himself where I could
not see him through the cab window. I examined
the revolver, which contained two charges, and then
walked up to the window. The villain had crouched
down by the fire-box, evidently having a wholesome
regard for the weapon in my hand. The engine
was going at the rate of thirty miles an hour, and I
judged that we had gone about ten miles.</p>

<p>“Christy Holgate, I don’t want to shoot you, but
I’ll do it, as sure as you live, if you don’t stop her!”
I shouted, as loud as I could yell, while I aimed
the revolver at him again.</p>

<p>“Don’t fire, Wolf, and I’ll stop her as soon as I
can,” he replied; and I think his guilty conscience
terrified him quite as much as the pistol.</p>

<p>He stood up, and I saw the pocket-book sticking
out of his outside breast pocket. I concluded that
he had taken it out to examine its contents, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
felt pretty confident that I should have the satisfaction
of restoring the lost treasure to my father.
With the revolver, containing two bullets, I realized
that I was master of the situation.</p>

<p>Christy shut off the steam, and put on the brake
just as we entered a dense wood. As the speed of
the engine slackened, I climbed upon the roof of
the cab, and jumped down upon the wood in the
tender. I took care not to go very near the villain,
for, even with the pistol in my hand, I thought he
was fully a match for me.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to shoot me, after all I’ve done
for you, Wolf?” said he, in a whining tone, as the
engine stopped.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you would serve my father such a
mean trick as you did,” I replied. “I will shoot
you if you don’t give up that pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to take your father’s money, Wolf.
He and I have been good friends for a great many
years, and I wouldn’t hurt him any more than I
would myself.”</p>

<p>“But you did take it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to keep it. I was only joking. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
meant to give it back to him; but when he flew at
me so, he made me mad.”</p>

<p>“What did you run away on the engine for,
then?” I demanded, willing, if possible, to accept
his explanation.</p>

<p>“You got me into the scrape, and I hardly knew
what I was about. I’m ruined now, and it won’t
do for me to go back.”</p>

<p>“You can go where you please; but give me that
pocket-book, Christy, or we’ll finish the business
here,” I continued, raising the pistol again.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll give it to you,” he answered,
handing me the pocket-book. “But I’m afraid to
go back myself.”</p>

<p>I put the treasure into my pocket, and felt that I
had won the day. Christy jumped from the engine,
and disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>ON THE LOCOMOTIVE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I was entirely satisfied with myself as I put the
pocket-book into my breast pocket, and carefully
buttoned my coat. I felt as though I had really
done “a big thing,” allowing the phrase to mean
even more than boys usually attach to it. How my
father would rejoice to see that money again! How
thankful he would be for the success which had
attended my efforts!</p>

<p>The pocket-book was in my possession, and I was
too much excited to look into it. I was somewhat
afraid, if I did not keep both eyes open, that Christy
would come out of the woods and undo the work I
had accomplished. I could hear him forcing his way
through the underbrush as he retreated; but I still
kept the revolver where I could make use of it if
occasion required. It seemed to me then that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
quarrel with Mr. Waddie had been a fortunate circumstance,
since the possession of the pistol had
enabled me to recover the pocket-book. I was
rather thankful to the scion for his agency in the
matter, and willing, when the time of settlement
came, to make some concessions, if needful, to his
vanity and pride.</p>

<p>Christy had piled the wood into the fire-box for
a hard run, and the locomotive was hissing and
quivering with the pressure of steam upon it. By
the unwritten law of succession, the care of the
machine devolved upon me, and I am willing to
confess that I was not displeased with the task imposed
upon me. To run the engine alone, with no
one to volunteer any instructions or limitations to
me, was a delightful duty; and I was so absorbed
by the prospect that I gave no further thought to
the pocket-book. It was safe, and that was enough.</p>

<p>I must run the locomotive back to Ucayga; but I
was fully equal to the task. I knew every part of
the machine, and had entire confidence in my own
ability. I did not exactly like to run her backwards;
but, as there was no turn-table at hand, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
had no choice. Reversing the valves, I let on the
steam very gradually, and the engine moved off according
to my calculations. I gave her more steam,
and she began to rush over the rails at a velocity
which startled me, when I considered that the motions
of the machine were under my control.</p>

<p>I had to keep a lookout over the top of the
tender, and at the same time watch the furnace, the
gauge-cocks, and the indicator; and of course I had
to observe them much more closely than would have
been necessary for a person of more experience.
Having my hands and my head full, something less
than thirty miles an hour was sufficient to gratify
my ambition. I knew nothing about the roads which
crossed the track, and therefore I kept up a constant
whistling and ringing of the bell. It was exciting, I
can testify, to any one who never tried to run a
locomotive under similar circumstances. I was doing
duty as engineer and fireman, and I could not think
of anything but the business in hand.</p>

<p>It would have been exceedingly awkward and unpleasant
to burst the boiler, or run over a vehicle
crossing the track, and I did not wish to have my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
first venture on a locomotive damaged by such an
accident. I kept a sharp lookout, both before and
behind me. It was a new position to me, and I
enjoyed the novelty of it, in spite of the fear of
being blown up, or smashed by a collision. I kept
the whistle sounding, and as the engine whirled
around a bend, after I had been running fifteen or
twenty minutes, I saw some men lifting a hand-car
from the track in great haste. They had heard
my warning in season to prevent the catastrophe I
dreaded.</p>

<p>“Stop her!” shouted one of the party, with all
his might, as the engine thundered by him.</p>

<p>A glance at the party assured me that one of them
was the engineer of the train. I shut off the steam,
and put on the brake. As it was a down grade, the
engine went about a mile before I could stop her.
But, as soon as I had brought her to a halt, I reversed
the valves again, and went ahead till I came
up with the party, who were just putting the hand-car
upon the track again. The engineer and fireman
leaped upon the foot-board. The former was
much excited, and I was not a little surprised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
find that he did not even thank me for bringing
back his engine.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean?” he demanded, with
an oath. “What did you run away with the engine
for?”</p>

<p>“I did not run away with her; I only brought
her back,” I replied, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Who was the man that stole the money?”</p>

<p>“That was Christy Holgate; he was the man
that ran away with the engine.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m Wolf Penniman. The money was stolen
from my father. When I saw Christy leap into the
cab, I jumped upon the cow-catcher.”</p>

<p>“Then you are the boy they were looking for
down to the station.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. I had a pistol, and I
made Christy stop her, and give me the pocket-book.
He got off then, and ran into the woods. I ran
the engine back again.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you didn’t shoot the rascal,” added
the engineer, as he examined into the condition of
the locomotive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>“I got the pocket-book again, and that was all I
wanted. I didn’t wish to kill him.”</p>

<p>“Who told you how to run an engine?” asked
the engineer, as he started the locomotive.</p>

<p>“My father is an engineer, and I’ve always been
among engines, though I never ran a locomotive
alone before.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think you can run one now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I can put her through by daylight,” I
replied, using a pet phrase of mine.</p>

<p>“You have done very well, sonny,” said he, with
a smile; and he could afford to smile, though he
growled a great deal at being an hour behind time
by the event of losing his engine.</p>

<p>He asked me a great many questions about Christy
and the robbery; and the conversation was only interrupted
by our arrival at the Ucayga station, where
the impatient passengers were waiting to continue
their journey. I jumped off; the engine was shackled
to the train again, and went on its way.</p>

<p>“Halloo, Wolf!” called the captain of the steamer
to me. “Where is Christy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. He jumped off the locomotive,
and ran away into the woods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p>A crowd of people gathered around me to hear
my story, for the facts of the robbery had been related
by my father. I felt the pocket-book in my
coat, and declined to answer any questions till I had
seen my father. I was told he was on board of the
steamer, and I hastened to find him. He was in
the engine-room, where I had left him. He was still
deadly pale, and seemed to have grown ten years
older in a single hour.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Wolf?” asked he, in a
voice almost choking with emotion.</p>

<p>“I have been after Christy.”</p>

<p>“Did you catch him?” he asked, in a sepulchral
tone.</p>

<p>“I was on the engine with him. Here is your
pocket-book, father.”</p>

<p>He grasped it with convulsive energy, and seemed
to grow young again in a moment. The crowd,
most of whom were passengers in the steamer, gathered
in the gangway, by the side of the engine-room,
to learn the facts. In an excited manner I began
to tell my story.</p>

<p>“What does he say? Speak louder, boy!” called
the men behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p>Though I did not feel like haranguing a multitude,
I raised my voice.</p>

<p>“Good! Good!” shouted the crowd, when I came
to the point where I aimed the revolver at Christy
in the cab. “Why didn’t you shoot him?”</p>

<p>“When I drew a bead upon him he stopped the
engine, and gave up the pocket-book,” I continued,
with boyish exhilaration.</p>

<p>“Wolf, you have saved me,” gasped my delighted
father; “but I am rather sorry you did not shoot
the villain.”</p>

<p>“We are wasting the whole day here,” said the
captain of the boat, nervously. “We have no engineer
now. Ralph, will you run us up the lake?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will,” replied my father, taking his
place at the machinery.</p>

<p>I sat down in the engine-room with him and answered
the questions he put to me about the affair.
He obeyed the signals given him by the bells, and
as soon as the boat was going ahead at full speed,
he took a seat at my side.</p>

<p>“Wolf, I have suffered more to-day than in all the
rest of my lifetime,” said he, wiping the perspiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
from his brow. “If I had lost that money, it would
well nigh have killed me. It was a lucky thing that
you took that pistol from Waddie.”</p>

<p>“It happened just right; Christy was afraid of it,
and when I got the muzzle to bear upon him, he
came down, like Crockett’s coon,” I answered, with
no little self-complaisance.</p>

<p>“Was he willing to give it up?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t help himself. If he hadn’t given it
up, I should have put a bullet through him.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t have to do that; on the
whole, though, I shouldn’t have cared much if you
had shot him,” added my father, putting his hand
upon the pocket-book to assure himself of its present
safety. “I wouldn’t have believed Christy could be
guilty of such a mean trick. But it was my fault,
Wolf. You saw how it was done, and it has been a
lesson to me which I shall never forget.”</p>

<p>My father sighed heavily as he thought of the circumstances,
and I fancy he promised himself then
never again to touch whiskey.</p>

<p>“Did Christy open the pocket-book?” he asked,
after a silence of some minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t see him open it, and I
don’t know when he could have had time to do so,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“It don’t look as though it had been touched,”
said he, taking the pocket-book from his pocket, and
proceeding to open it.</p>

<p>“I guess it is all right, father,” I added.</p>

<p>“All right!” gasped he. “There is not a single
dollar in it!”</p>

<p>My father groaned in bitterness of spirit. I looked
into the open pocket-book. The money had all been
taken from it!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>THE VIAL OF WRATH.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I was both amazed and confounded when it was
ascertained that the pocket-book did not contain
the money. From the depth of despair my father
and myself had gone up to the pinnacle of hope,
when the treasure was supposed to be found; and
now we fell back into a deeper gulf than that into
which we had first fallen. Those with whom money
is plenty cannot understand the greatness of my
father’s loss. For years he had toiled and saved in
order to clear the house in which we lived. He
had struggled with, and conquered, the appetite for
intoxicating drinks, in order to accomplish his great
purpose.</p>

<p>He had been successful. He had kept away from
the drunkard’s bowl, he had lived prudently, he had
carefully husbanded all his resources, and, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
time my story begins, he felt that the pretty little
place where we lived actually belonged to him. It
was always to be the home of his family, and
it was all the more loved and prized because it had
been won by constant toil and careful saving. This
was the feeling of my father, as it was my own,
when we started for Ucayga to draw the money
from the bank. We felt like the king and the
prince who had won a great victory, and were to
march in triumph into the conquered possession.</p>

<p>My father was elated by what he had accomplished.
The mortgage note for two thousand dollars
would be due the next week, and he had the
money to pay it, with enough to make the coveted
improvements. It would have been better if he had
not been elated; for this feeling led him to believe
that, as the battle had been won, there was no
longer any need of the vigilance with which he
had guarded himself. He had raised the cup to
his lips, and in a moment, as it were, his brilliant
fortune deserted him; the savings of years were
wrenched from his relaxed grasp.</p>

<p>I do not wonder, as I consider how prudent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
careful he had been, that he sank into the depths
of despair when he found the money was really
gone. The struggle had been long and severe, the
victory sublime and precious; and now the defeat,
in the moment of conquest, was terrible in the
extreme. I trembled for my father while I gazed
into his pale face, and observed the sweep of his
torturing emotions, as they were displayed in his
expression.</p>

<p>For my own part, I was intensely mortified at
the result of my efforts. I felt cheap and mean, as
I sank down from the height to which I had lifted
myself, and realized that all my grand deeds had
been but a farce. If I had only looked into the
pocket-book when Christy returned it to me, I
might have saved this terrible fall. The villain had
probably taken the money from it while he was
crouching down by the fire-box. He had played a
trick upon me, and I had been an easy victim. I
was but a boy, while I had felt myself to be a
man, and had behaved like a boy. If I had been
smart in one respect, I had been stupid in another.
I blamed myself severely for permitting myself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
be duped by Christy at the moment when he was
in my power. I almost wished that I had shot
him; but I am sure now that I should have felt
ten times worse if I had killed him, even if I had
obtained the money by doing so.</p>

<p>“I am ruined, Wolf,” groaned my father, as he
dropped upon the seat in the engine-room. “I shall
never get the money now.”</p>

<p>“I think you will, father,” I replied, trying to be
hopeful rather than confident.</p>

<p>“No; I shall never see a dollar of it again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give it up yet, father. Christy has gone
off in his every-day clothes, and left his family at
Ucayga. He will come back again, or you will get
some clew to him.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” said my father, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“But something must be done. Christy isn’t a
great way off, and we must put him through by
daylight,” I added.</p>

<p>“What can we do? It isn’t much use to do any
thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. Something can be done, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Where are we now, Wolf?” asked my father.</p>

<p>I did not know where we were, for there was no
chance to see the shore from the engine-room. I
walked out on the forward deck, and returned immediately.</p>

<p>“Well, where are we, Wolf?” demanded my father,
rather sharply, as he laid down the glass from which
he had just drained another dram taken from
Christy’s queer-shaped bottle.</p>

<p>“We are just off the North Shoe,” I replied, as
gloomily as though another third of my father’s
worldly wealth had also taken to itself wings.</p>

<p>My poor father was drinking whiskey again. In
his depression and despair, the bottle seemed to be
his only resource. I have since learned enough of
human nature to understand how it was with him.
Men in the sunlight of prosperity play with the
fiend of the cup. Full of life, full of animal spirits,
it is comparatively easy to control the appetite.
But when the hour of despondency comes; when
depression invades the mind; when earthly possessions
elude the grasp—then they flee to the consolations
of the cup. It gives an artificial strength,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and men who in prosperity might always have kept
sober and temperate, in adversity are lost in the
whirlpool of tippling and inebriation.</p>

<p>Thus it seemed to be with my father. He had
begun to drink that day in the elation of his spirits;
he was now resorting to the cup as an antidote for
depression and despair. The dram had its temporary
effect; but, while he was cheered by the fiery
draught, I trembled for him. I feared that this was
only the beginning of the end—that he needed
prosperity to save him from himself.</p>

<p>“Off the North Shoe,” said he; but he was not
<ins id='c077' title='original: ably'>able</ins> wholly to conceal his vexation that I had seen
him take the glass from his lips. “We shall be in
Ruoara in half an hour, and I will send a sheriff
after the villain. You say Christy went about ten
miles, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; as nearly as I could guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll catch him yet,” added my father, confidently.
“Have an eye to the engine, Wolf, while I
go and see the captain about it.”</p>

<p>My father left the engine-room, which he would
not have done if he had not supposed me entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
competent to run the machine. I determined to
have an eye to something besides the engine. In
my father’s present state of mind, I feared he would
drink till he was helpless. I raised the lid of the
seat and took out the strange bottle. It was about
half full. There was mischief enough left in it to
rob my father of all his senses.</p>

<p>Even as a boy I prided myself on my promptness
in action. The present seemed to be a moment
when it was my duty to cast out an evil spirit. I
took the bottle to the gangway, where there was a
large scupper-hole to let the water run off when the
decks were washed down. Into this I emptied the
contents of the “vial of wrath.” The fiery liquid
ran through and mingled with the clear waters of
the lake. Having no spite against the bottle, I returned
it to the locker in the engine-room, rather
to save my father the trouble of looking for it than
because I had any regard for its preservation.</p>

<p>Presently my father returned with the captain of
the steamer, who did not seem to relish the idea
of leaving the engine in charge of a boy of fifteen.
They talked about the lost money, and my father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
was tolerably cheerful under the influence of the
dram he had taken. The captain said that Mr. Mortimer,
the sheriff, was almost always on the wharf
when the steamer made her landing, and that he
would be glad to start instantly in pursuit of the
robber. It was a kind of business which he enjoyed,
and if any one could catch Christy, he could.
I was quite satisfied with this arrangement, and so
was my father.</p>

<p>When the boat touched at Ruoara, Mr. Mortimer
was on the pier, as the captain had said he would be.
He was more than willing to undertake the task
of pursuing the thief, and the steamer was detained
at the landing long enough for him to procure a
warrant for the arrest of the fugitive. He was to
cross the lake to the next port on the other side,
from which he was to proceed, by private conveyance,
to the town nearest to the point where Christy
had left the locomotive. Mr. Mortimer came into
the engine-room as the boat started, and we gave
him all the information we possessed in regard to
the robber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Mortimer, won’t you take something before
you go ashore?” said my father.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t care if I do,” replied the
sheriff. “I have had a cold for two or three days
and a little of the ardent won’t hurt me, though I
am not in the habit of taking it very often.”</p>

<p>“It will do you good; it does me good,” added
my father, as he raised the lid of the locker and
took out the queer bottle.</p>

<p>The “vial of wrath” was empty. My father
looked at me—looked uglier than I had ever seen
him look before. He held it over the glass, and
inverted it. My work had been thoroughly accomplished,
and hardly a drop of the fiery fluid answered
the summons to appear. My father looked
at me again. His lips were compressed, and his
eyes snapped with anger.</p>

<p>“All gone—is it?” laughed the sheriff. “Well,
no matter; I can get along without it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take some at the bar,” said my father, as
the bell rang to “slow” her.</p>

<p>When the boat was fast to the wharf, they went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to the bar and drank together. Somehow, it seemed
to me that all my calculations were failing on that
day; but still I hoped to accomplish something by
the deed I had done. Mr. Mortimer went on shore,
and my father returned to the engine-room. I
hoped he would be satisfied with the dram he had
taken, and that I should escape the consequences of
his anger. The bell rang, and the boat started
again.</p>

<p>“Wolf, did you empty that bottle?” asked my
father, sternly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did,” I replied, gently, but firmly.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was best not to have the liquor
here,” I answered, with no little trepidation.</p>

<p>“Best!” exclaimed he. “Who made you a keeper
over me?”</p>

<p>I did not dare to say anything. I held my peace,
resolved to endure the storm in silence, lest some
disrespectful word should escape my lips. My father
was very angry, and I feared that, under the influence
of the liquor, he would do violence to me;
but he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>“Get away from here! Don’t let me see you
around me any longer,” said he, at last, when he
found that I was not disposed to explain my conduct,
or to cast any reproaches upon him.</p>

<p>I went to the forward deck, and seated myself on
the rail at the bow.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>THE DUMMY ENGINE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>My father and I had always been on the best
of terms. He was very considerate to me,
and used to talk with me a great deal; indeed, he
treated me in such a way that I had very little
reason to think I was a boy. He discussed his
plans with me, and often asked my advice, just as
though I had been a man of mature judgment. He
was angry with me now, almost for the first time
in my remembrance; certainly he had never before
been so highly exasperated with me. But I consoled
myself with the reflection that he was partially
intoxicated, and that, when the fumes of the
whiskey had worked off, he would be as kind and
gentle to me as ever.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was wrong for me to empty the bottle;
but, as I can never know what would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
happened if I had not done so, I am content with
simply believing that I did it for the best. He was
in charge of the engine. There were fifty precious
lives on the boat. My father had the reputation of
being a very steady and reliable man. If he had
been a little noisy and turbulent at Ucayga, the
shock of losing his money had wrought a sudden
and wonderful change in his manner, so that few,
if any, had noticed him. After the steamer started,
I alone was aware of his condition; I alone knew
of his resuming his cups; and I alone knew that,
left to himself, he would soon be intoxicated, and
incapable of managing the engine. I could not wish
that I had not emptied the bottle, even while I
suffered intensely under the consciousness of his
displeasure.</p>

<p>While I was thinking of the wrath of my father,
and of the consequences which might follow the
loss of the money, the steamer approached Middleport,
which was opposite Centreport, where we
lived. My attention was immediately attracted by
a singular-looking object on the canal boat at the
wharf. My thoughts were partially diverted for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
time from the painful circumstances of our family
affairs, and I gazed with interest at the strange
object. It looked like an immense omnibus, only
it had a smoke-stack passing through the roof at
one end. I had never seen such a thing before,
and I did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>“Ah, the dummy has arrived,” said a Middleport
passenger, who had come forward to look at the
carriage.</p>

<p>“The what, sir?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The dummy.”</p>

<p>“What’s a dummy?” I inquired; for, with all
my study of steam-engines, I had never heard of
one.</p>

<p>“It’s a railroad car with an engine in one end of
it,” replied the gentleman; and by this time I could
make out the form of the thing. “It is for the
Lake Shore Railroad. I suppose you have heard
that the students of the Toppleton Institute are
building a railroad on the shore of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“This dummy was built to run on a horse railroad
in Philadelphia; but though they call it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
dummy, it made so much noise, and frightened so
many horses, they could not use it in the streets.
Major Toppleton saw it, and bought it cheap, for
the students, in order to get a little ahead of
the Wimpleton Institute, on the other side of the
lake.”</p>

<p>As the boat approached the wharf, I examined
the dummy very carefully. It was a railway carriage,
similar to those used on street roads, having
an engine in one end to propel it. It would be a
rare plaything for the Toppletonians, and I envied
them the possession of such a prize. I knew all
about the Lake Shore Railroad, and many a pang
of jealousy had it caused the Wimpletonians, on our
side of the lake; for a stupendous rivalry existed
between the two Institutes, which were separated
from each other by only a mile of fresh water.</p>

<p>Lake Ucayga is about forty-five miles long. At
the foot of it was the town of the same name, connected
with the great centres of travel by railroad.
At the head of the lake was the large town of
Hitaca. The average width of the lake was three
miles; but near the middle—or, to be more accurate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
twenty miles from Ucayga, and twenty-five
from Hitaca—a point of land jutted out on the
west side, so as to leave a passage only a mile in
width. On this peninsula was located the town
of Middleport, and directly opposite was Centreport.</p>

<p>Below these towns the country was level, while
above them it was hilly, and even mountainous near
the head of the lake. Middleport and Centreport
were of very modern origin, so far as their social
and commercial importance was concerned, and their
growth and history were somewhat remarkable.
They are located on the verge of the hilly region,
and the scenery around them, without being grand
or sublime, is very beautiful.</p>

<p>Hardly twenty years before my story opens, two
gentlemen had come up to the lake to spend a week
in hunting and fishing. They were fast friends, and
each of them had made an immense fortune in the
China trade. The narrow part of the lake—generally
called “The Narrows”—attracted their attention
on account of its picturesque scenery. They
were delighted with the spot, and the result was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that, on retiring from business, they fixed their residences
here.</p>

<p>One of these gentlemen was Colonel Wimpleton,
and the other was Major Toppleton. They had
won their military titles in the same regiment of
militia in their early life, and had clung together
like brothers for many years. They built their elegant
mansions on the banks of the lake, facing
each other, and formerly gayly-painted barges were
continually plying between them. Certainly their
houses looked like palaces of enchantment, so elegantly
were the grounds laid out, and so picturesque
were the surroundings. In front of each, on
the lake, was a wall of dressed stone, from the
quarries in the neighborhood. From these walls,
the grounds, covered with the richest green in summer,
sloped gradually up to the houses. They were
adorned with smooth walks and avenues, shaded with
a variety of trees. Indeed, I think nothing more
lovely was ever seen or imagined.</p>

<p>Major Toppleton, on the Middleport side, built a
flour mill; the village began to grow, and soon
became a place of considerable commercial importance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
At the same time, Centreport increased in
population and wealth, though not so rapidly as its
neighbor on the other side of the lake. Both the
gentlemen had sons; and they were alive to the
importance of giving them a good education. This
consideration induced them to discuss the propriety
of establishing an academy, and both agreed that
such an institution was desirable, especially as there
was not one of high standing within fifty miles of
the place. Then the difficult and delicate question
of the location of the proposed academy came up
for settlement. Each of them wanted it on his side
of the lake; and on this rock the two friends, who
had been almost brothers for forty years, split; and
the warmth of their former friendship seemed to be
the gauge of their present enmity.</p>

<p>The feud waxed fierce and bitter; and henceforth
Middleport and Centreport, which had always
been twin sisters, were savage foes. The major built
a lofty edifice and called it the Toppleton Institute.
The colonel, not to be thwarted or outdone, built
another on a grander scale, and called it the Wimpleton
Institute. Everything that could add to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
efficiency and the popularity of the two institutions
was liberally supplied; and, as competition is the life
of trade, as well in literary as in commercial affairs,
both thrived splendidly. All the principal cities and
towns of the Union were represented among the
students. The patron <i>millionnaire</i> of each, with his
principal and teachers, labored and studied to devise
some new schemes which would add to the
popularity of his institution. Military drill, gymnastics,
games, boating, English, French, and German
systems were introduced, and dispensed with as
fresher novelties were presented.</p>

<p>The rival academies numbered about a hundred
students each, and neither seemed to obtain any
permanent advantage over the other. “Like master
like man;” and, as the major and the colonel quarrelled,
the pupils could hardly help following their
illustrious example; so that it was fortunate a mile of
deep water lay between the two.</p>

<p>The rivalry of the <i>millionnaires</i> was not confined
to the schools; it extended to the towns themselves.
Colonel Wimpleton built a flour mill on the Centreport
side, and fought boldly and cunningly for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the commercial salvation of his side of the lake. If
a bank, an insurance company, or a sawmill was
established in Middleport, another immediately appeared
in Centreport; and the converse of the proposition
was equally true.</p>

<p>In the midst of this rivalry the Toppleton Institute
was vivified by a new idea. The mania for
building railroads which pervaded the Northern
States invaded the quiet haunts of learning. Many
of the students were the sons of prominent railroad
men, and Major Toppleton hit upon the magnificent
scheme of giving the young gentlemen a railroad
education. A company had been organized; certificates
of stocks and bonds—of which the munificent
patron of the institution was the largest holder—were
issued. A president, directors, treasurer, and
clerk were elected; superintendents, track-masters,
baggage-masters, conductors, brakemen, engineers,
firemen, switch-tenders, and other officials were duly
appointed. At first the railroad was to be an imaginary
concern; but the wealthy patron was not content
to have the business done on paper only. He
purchased sleepers and rails, and the students had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
actually built five miles of road on the level border
of the lake. The dummy engine had been
bought, and had been sent by railroad to the head
of the lake, and thence to Middleport by a canal
boat.</p>

<p>This splendid project of the Toppletonians was
viewed with consternation by the Wimpletonians.
I was warmly interested in the scheme, and watched
its progress with the deepest interest. The dummy
was a miracle to me, and I regarded it with the
most intense delight. All the Toppletonians, assisted
by a few men, were on the shore, busy as
bees in transferring the machine to the wharf.
Planks had been laid down on which to roll it
from the boat, and rigging manned by the students
was attached to it, by which it was to be hauled
on shore.</p>

<p>The steamer was to make a landing alongside
the canal boat. I stood at the bow watching the
operation of moving the dummy. They had rolled
it two or three feet up the skids; but “too many
cooks spoil the broth.” A rope broke, the machine
slipped back, and, canting the boat by its impetus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the thing rolled off, with a tremendous splash, into
the lake. The steamer backed just in season to
avoid smashing it into a hopeless wreck.</p>

<p>If Centreport had been there it would have rejoiced
exceedingly at this mishap.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>TOPPLETONIANS AND WIMPLETONIANS.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>Middleport had a terrible fall in the unfortunate
slip of the dummy engine; and if
any Wimpletonians, on the other side of the lake,
witnessed the catastrophe, I am afraid they were
ill-natured enough to “crow” over it; for to have
seen the thing hissing up and down on the opposite
shore would have been a sore trial to them. For
the present, at least, it was safe on the bottom of
the lake, though, as the water was only six or eight
feet deep, the machine would doubtless be saved in
the end.</p>

<p>Though I belonged to Centreport, and was a graduate
of the Wimpleton Institute, I could not find it
in my heart to rejoice at the disaster which had befallen
the Toppletonians. I was too much interested
in the dummy to cherish any ill-will towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
machine or its owners. I wanted to see it work,
and I could not help envying the engineer who was
to enjoy the superlative happiness of running it.
Such a position would have suited me, and I was
sorry the railroad idea had not originated on our
side of the lake. I wondered what Colonel Wimpleton
would bring forward to offset this novelty of
his rival, not doubting that he would make a desperate
effort to outdo the major.</p>

<p>The accident filled the Toppletonians with dismay.
They had been yelling with excitement and delight
while laboring at the skids and rigging; but now
they were aghast and silent. The Ruoara backed
away from the submerged machine, and made her
landing at the end of the pier. The dummy rested
upright upon the bottom of the lake, with its roof
well out of the water. I hardly took my eyes off of
it while we were at the wharf, and I only wished the
task of putting it on the track of the Lake Shore
Railroad had fallen on me; for I thought I saw a
plan by which it could be easily accomplished.</p>

<p>While the steamer was waiting I stepped upon
the wharf, and mingled with the crowd of dismayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Toppletonians, who were gazing at the apparent wreck
of all their hopes. I was acquainted with a few of
them; but they regarded me with a feeling of jealousy
and hatred which I am happy to state that I
did not share with them.</p>

<p>“Our pipe is out,” said Tommy Toppleton, the
only son of the major. “It’s too confounded bad!
I meant to have a ride in that car by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“It’s not so bad as it might be,” I ventured to
remark.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” snapped Tommy, when he recognized
me as a Centreporter.</p>

<p>“I belong on the other side, I know; but I was
really sorry to see the thing go overboard,” I added,
gently enough to disarm the wrath of the patron’s
son.</p>

<p>“I think the Wimpleton fellows will feel good
over this,” continued Tommy, who, if he had not
been crestfallen at the misfortune of his clan, would
have been impudent and overbearing to a plebeian
like me.</p>

<p>“I suppose they will feel good; but if I were one
of your fellows I would not let them enjoy it a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
while. I would have it out of the water and get
up steam before I slept upon it,” I answered.</p>

<p>“What would you do?” asked Tommy curiously.</p>

<p>“I would get it out of the water in double-quick
time, and then put her through by daylight, even if
it took me all night.”</p>

<p>“You are a brick, Wolf; and I am rather sorry
you live on the other side of the lake,” laughed the
scion of the Middleport house. “Do you think you
could get her out of the water?”</p>

<p>“I know I could.”</p>

<p>“How would you do it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t time to explain it now,” I replied,
edging towards the steamer.</p>

<p>“I say, Wolf, people think you know all about an
engine, and can run one as well as a man,” continued
Tommy, following me to the boat.</p>

<p>“I ran a locomotive ten miles to-day.”</p>

<p>“Did you, though?”</p>

<p>“I did—all alone.”</p>

<p>“Our fellows don’t want a man for an engineer
on the Lake Shore Railroad; some of them were
talking about having you to run the dummy for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p>“I am much obliged to them for thinking of me.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad you live on the other side.”</p>

<p>I thought so too, as the bell of the Ruoara rang,
and I stepped on board of her. To do anything for
the enemy on the Middleport side would be to give
mortal offence to Colonel Wimpleton, his hopeful
son, and all the students of the Institute in Centreport;
and it was quite out of the question for me to
think of a position on the foot-board of the dummy.
I would have given anything to join the Toppletonians,
against whom I had now no spite, and take
part in the operations of the new railroad; and I
regarded it as a very great misfortune that the
rivalry between the two places prevented me from
doing so.</p>

<p>The Ruoara left the wharf, and stood across the
lake towards Centreport. As she receded from the
shore, I saw Tommy talking to his father, and pointing
to the boat, as though I were the subject of the
conversation. I do not know what either of them
said; but the young gentleman doubtless told the
patron of the Toppletonians that I considered myself
able to extricate the dummy from her present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
position. I was a very modest young man at the
time of which I write; but years have enabled me,
in some measure, to conquer the feeling, and I may
now say that I had a splendid reputation as an
engineer, for a boy. I do not know that I was
regarded as exactly a prodigy, but even men of ability
treated me with great kindness and consideration
on account of my proficiency in matters relating to
machinery. It seemed quite possible, therefore, that
Major Toppleton did not regard my suggestion of a
plan to extricate the dummy as a mere boyish boast.</p>

<p>Whether he did or did not, I was too much
oppressed by my father’s misfortunes to think of the
dummy after it was out of sight. I walked aft,
passing through the gangway, where I could see my
unfortunate parent. He looked stern and forbidding,
and, when I paused at the door, he told me I need
not stop there. I did not think he had been drinking
again, and I felt sure that he would not long
be angry. It made me very sad to think that he
was offended with me; but, more than this, I dreaded
lest he should fall back into his old habits, and
become a drunkard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p>As the steamer approached the Centreport landing,
I was startled by three rousing cheers. On the lawn,
which faced the river in front of the Wimpleton
Institute, were assembled all the students. Two or
three of them were looking through field glasses to
the opposite shore. They had just discovered the
nature of the disaster to the dummy, and they expressed
their satisfaction in the cheers which I heard.
It was mean and cowardly to rejoice in the misfortunes
of others, even if they were enemies; but as their
elders expressed themselves in this manner, nothing
better could be expected of them.</p>

<p>I went ashore when the boat was made fast. I
noticed that several people looked sharply at me,
and some of them appeared to make remarks about
me, as I passed through the crowd up the wharf;
but so completely had my thoughts been absorbed
by the affairs of my father, that I had quite forgotten
my altercation with Mr. Waddie Wimpleton,
and I did not connect the sharp looks and the
suppressed remarks bestowed upon me with that
circumstance. I had the young gentleman’s revolver
in my pocket; but I had ceased to feel its weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
or to think of it. I walked up the wharf, and hastened
to the cottage of my father.</p>

<p>“Why, Wolfert! What have you been doing?”
exclaimed my mother, as I entered the kitchen, where
she was at work.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong, I hope, mother,” I replied; and
I am sure my long face and sad demeanor were not
without their effect upon her.</p>

<p>“They are telling awful stories about you, Wolfert,”
she added.</p>

<p>“Who are?”</p>

<p>“Everybody. What have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t done anything, mother.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you take the powder from the tool-house
at the quarry, and blow up that canal boat?” gasped
she, horrified that I should be even accused of such
wickedness.</p>

<p>“No, mother; I did not. Who says I did?”</p>

<p>“Everybody is saying so. We all know that the
canal boat was blown up; and they say you ran away
before the people came.”</p>

<p>I told my mother the whole truth in regard to
the canal boat, and she believed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p>“Waddie Wimpleton says you did it, Wolfert,”
added she.</p>

<p>“I did not do it, and did not know anything
about it till the explosion took place.”</p>

<p>“They all say you must have done it. Waddie
don’t deny that he had a hand in it; but he says
you planned the whole thing, and he gave you his
revolver for doing it.”</p>

<p>“There is not a word of truth in it, mother.”</p>

<p>“The quarrymen saw you and Waddie near the
mill wharf, just before the explosion. It was not till
they had told their story that Waddie acknowledged
he had anything to do with it. He says it was
done by pulling a string; and everybody believes
that boy hadn’t gumption enough to blow up the
canal boat without blowing himself up with it.
They say the thing was well done, and therefore
you must have done it.”</p>

<p>This was flattering to my pride, disagreeable as
the consequences threatened to be. People believed
I was guilty because I had the reputation of being
skilful in mechanical contrivances! But I was not
anxious to rob Waddie of any of his honors in this
affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p>“I have not done anything wrong, mother; and I
am willing to take the consequences, whatever they
are. I wish this was the only thing we had to fear,”
I said, dreading the effect upon her of the intelligence
I had to communicate in regard to my father.</p>

<p>“Why, what else have we to fear?” asked she,
with an expression of alarm. “Where is your
father?”</p>

<p>“He has gone up to Hitaca in the steamer.”</p>

<p>“What has he gone up there for?”</p>

<p>“He is in charge of the engine of the Ruoara.”</p>

<p>“Where is Christy Holgate?”</p>

<p>“He has robbed a man of his money, and run
away.”</p>

<p>“Christy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother; and that isn’t the worst of it,
either.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean, Wolfert?”</p>

<p>“Father was the man whom he robbed.”</p>

<p>“Why, Wolfert!” ejaculated my mother, as pale
as death.</p>

<p>“It is just as I say, mother; and it isn’t the worst
of it, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear! What else has happened?” she demanded,
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Father has taken to drinking again,” I replied;
and, no longer able to restrain my emotions, I burst
into tears.</p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven! That is worse than all the
rest!” exclaimed she, covering her face with her
apron, and weeping bitterly with me.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>COLONEL WIMPLETON AND SON.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>My mother wept as she thought of the past,
and dreaded the future. It would have been
comparatively easy to endure the loss of the twenty-four
hundred dollars; but it was intolerable to think
of the misery of again being a drunkard’s wife. All
else was as nothing to her beside this awful prospect.
My father had struggled with his besetting
and his besotting sin for five years, and with hardly
an exception had always been the conqueror. During
this period he had prospered in his worldly affairs,
and till this day of disaster the future seemed to be
secure to him.</p>

<p>My mother told me I had done right in emptying
the bottle, and assured me that my father would
not long cherish his anger. She knew not what to
do in order to turn the tide which had set against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
us. If the sheriff succeeded in arresting Christy,
and securing the money he had stolen, the effect
upon my father would be good. If the money was
lost, we feared that father would be lost with it.</p>

<p>While we were talking about the sad prospect
before us, an imperative knock was heard at the
front door—a summons so loud and stately that
we could hardly fail to identify the person even
before we saw his face. My mother wiped away
her bitter tears, and hastened to the door.</p>

<p>“Has your son come home?” demanded Colonel
Wimpleton, in his abrupt and offensive manner,
when he spoke to his social inferiors, as he regarded
them.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he has,” replied my mother, with fear
and trembling before the magnate of Centreport.</p>

<p>Without further ceremony, or any ceremony,—for
he had used none,—he stalked into the kitchen
where I sat. He was followed by his hopeful scion,
who looked quite as magnificent as his stately
father.</p>

<p>“So you have come home, you young villain!”
said the colonel, fixing a savage gaze upon me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>“I have come home; but I am not a villain, sir,”
I replied, with what dignity I could command.</p>

<p>“Don’t contradict me. I say you are a villain.”</p>

<p>“Your saying so don’t make it so,” I answered,
desperately; for I was goaded almost to despair by
the misfortunes of the day; and though at any other
time I should have been as meek as a nursing dove,
I felt like defending myself from the charges he was
about to make.</p>

<p>“Don’t be impudent to me, young man,” scowled
he. “You know me, and you know what I am.”</p>

<p>“I know what you are,” I added, significantly;
and I was astonished at my own boldness.</p>

<p>He looked at me savagely, apparently trying to
determine what construction to put upon my remark.
Waddie stood at his side, quite self-possessed,
considering the wicked deed he had done.
His presence reminded me of the revolver I had
in my pocket, and I took it out and presented it
to him.</p>

<p>“Here is your revolver, Waddie. I did not intend
to keep it, when I took it,” said I.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it. It is yours now,” replied he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
declining to take the weapon. “I gave it to you
for the job you did for me, and I am not going
to back out now.”</p>

<p>“Take it, Waddie,” interposed his father. “Such
a trade is not legal or binding.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to take it,” replied the hopeful,
stoutly. “It was a fair trade, and it would not be
honorable for me to back out.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me, then,” added the colonel.</p>

<p>I gave it to him, and he put it in his pocket, in
spite of the protest of Waddie.</p>

<p>“Now, Wolf, I want you to tell me the truth,”
continued Colonel Wimpleton.</p>

<p>“I will do so, sir.”</p>

<p>“You persuaded my boy to blow up that canal
boat?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I did not.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he persuaded me to do it, father,”
interrupted the son.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have done such a thing as that
unless somebody put you up to it, Waddie,” protested
the fond father, who had been obliged to
make the same statement fifty times before, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
remained obstinately incredulous in regard to his
son’s capacity to do mischief up to the present time.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would, father; and I am only sorry the
skipper of the canal boat was not on board when
she went up. Didn’t I say he insulted me? Didn’t
I tell you he shook me, kicked me, cuffed me, and
then chucked me on the wharf, as though I had
been a dead cat? When a man insults me, he has
to pay for it,” said Waddie, shaking his head to
emphasize his strong declarations.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I shall have to pay for it too,” muttered
the colonel, who felt very much as the man
did who had to pay his wife’s fine after he had
prosecuted her for an assault upon himself.</p>

<p>“No matter for that; I am revenged,” added
Waddie, coolly. “I only said that Wolf showed
me how to do it, and pulled the string when all
was ready.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” replied the father.</p>

<p>I understood the magnate of Centreport well
enough to comprehend his position. He was quite
willing to pay a couple of thousand dollars for the
destruction of the canal boat; but he was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
loath to have the Centreporters believe, what was
literally the truth, that Waddie Wimpleton was the
worst and most evil-disposed boy in the whole town.
While he did not attempt to discipline and control
his vicious heir, he was exceedingly jealous of the
youth’s reputation. He wished to have me confess
that I had had a finger in this pie of mischief. My
character stood high in town, for I had tried to behave
like a gentleman on all occasions. If I shared
the blame with the colonel’s hopeful, he was willing
to pay all costs and damages. I really believe, if I
could have assumed the entire odium of the wicked
deed, the magnate would have been willing to pay
for the boat, and give me a thousand dollars besides.
In fact, I knew of one instance in which a
boy of bad habits had been indirectly paid for taking
upon his own shoulders the blame that belonged
upon Waddie’s.</p>

<p>“I had nothing at all to do with blowing up the
canal boat, Colonel Wimpleton,” I replied. “I knew
nothing about it till the explosion took place.”</p>

<p>“You deny it—do you?” demanded the magnate,
sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>“I do, sir; I had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“How dare you lie to me? As Waddie was concerned
in the affair, I don’t mind paying for the
boat, and I suppose that will be the end of the
scrape; but I know my boy wouldn’t do such a
thing without some help.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t help him,” I protested, warmly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you pull the string?” demanded Waddie,
with the most unblushing effrontery.</p>

<p>“No, I did not.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have hold of the string when the
boat went up?” persisted the young villain.</p>

<p>“I did, but”—</p>

<p>“There, father, he owns up to all I ask him to
confess,” interposed Waddie.</p>

<p>“I own up to nothing,” I replied, indignantly. “I
say, again, I had nothing to do with the explosion,
and knew nothing about it till the boat blew up.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, you young rascal?” stormed
the colonel. “One moment you say you had hold
of the string, and the next that you knew nothing
about it.”</p>

<p>“If you wish me to explain the matter, I will do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
so; if not, I won’t,” I added, disgusted with the
evident intention of the magnate to convict me,
whether guilty or not.</p>

<p>“Will you confess that you had a hand in the
mischief?”</p>

<p>“No, I will not.”</p>

<p>“But, you young rascal”—</p>

<p>“I am not a rascal, Colonel Wimpleton. If
either of us is a rascal, you are the one, not I,” I
continued, goaded to desperation by his injustice.</p>

<p>“What!” gasped the great man, confounded at
my boldness.</p>

<p>“I say just what I mean. Waddie knows, as
well as I do, that I had nothing to do with blowing
up the canal boat, and if he was a decent fellow he
would say so.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be rash, Wolfert,” interposed my mother,
alarmed at my temerity.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of them, mother.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say I’m not a decent fellow?”
howled Waddie.</p>

<p>“I did say so, and I meant to say so. You know
that you lie when you say I had anything to do with
blowing up the boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>“Do you tell me I lie?”</p>

<p>“I do; I tell you so with all my might,” I persisted,
boldly.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about this,” said Colonel Wimpleton,
furiously. “Mrs. Penniman, your boy is impudent—impudent
to me, and to my son.”</p>

<p>“You accuse him of something he didn’t do, and
won’t hear what he has to say,” replied my mother,
meekly.</p>

<p>“Accuse him of what he didn’t do! Didn’t he
say he had hold of the string? Wolf had the
pistol, too, and that proves the truth of what Waddie
said. How came you by the pistol?” demanded
the magnate, turning fiercely to me.</p>

<p>“I took it away from Waddie when he threatened
to shoot me with it, and after he had fired
one ball at me.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to make it out that my boy intended
to murder you? Once more, will you confess
to me, or will you have it proved before a
justice?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care where you prove it; but I shall
not confess what I didn’t do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>“My son speaks the truth, Mrs. Penniman, though
he may be a little wild sometimes.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a bigger liar in town,” said I, very
imprudently.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, marm?” snapped the colonel.
“Didn’t my son confess that he had a hand in the
mischief? Doesn’t that show that he is a truthful
boy? Wolf is violent and abusive. I have done
what I could for your family, Mrs. Penniman.”</p>

<p>“I know you have, Mr. Wimpleton, and we
are all very grateful to you,” replied my trembling
mother.</p>

<p>“I should think you were! You permit this
young rascal to insult and abuse me and my son.
He calls me a rascal, and my son a liar. Is that
his gratitude?” continued the much-abused great
man. “You will hear from me again, Mrs. Penniman.”</p>

<p>“And you will hear from me again, Wolf Penniman.
I don’t allow any fellow to call me a liar,”
added Waddie, bristling up like a bantam rooster.</p>

<p>“You permit this young cub to insult and abuse
me,” persisted the magnate, as he bolted out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
front door, followed by his hopeful, who could not
help shaking his fist at me as he went out.</p>

<p>“What have you done, Wolf?” exclaimed my
mother, when they had gone.</p>

<p>“I have spoken the truth, like a man,” I replied,
though I trembled for the consequences of my bold
speech to the great man.</p>

<p>“He will discharge your father; and, now the
money is gone, he will turn us out of house and
home,” added my mother, beginning to cry again.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. I have only told the truth, and
I am not going to cower before that man and that
boy any longer.”</p>

<p>I took my cap and left the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>BETTER THOUGHTS AND DEEDS.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I left the house more to conceal my own emotions
than for any other reason. I had been
imprudent. My father was not only dependent upon
Colonel Wimpleton for the excellent situation he
held, which had enabled him to live well, to give
me a good education, and to save money to buy
his place, though there was a mortgage on the little
estate that would expire in a few days; so far as
liberality in financial matters was concerned, no one
could find any fault with the magnate of Centreport.</p>

<p>I was accused of a crime—not merely of a piece
of mischief, as the colonel was pleased to regard it,
but of a crime whose penalty was imprisonment.
By merely admitting the truth of the charge, I
could escape all disagreeable consequences, and retain
for my father and myself the favor of the mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
man in whose smile we had prospered and grown
rich. Doubtless, in the worldly sense, I had been
very imprudent. It would have been safer for me
not to deny the accusation, and not to resent the
hard names applied to me.</p>

<p>As a matter of policy, I had always permitted
Waddie to have his own way in his dealings with
me. If he ordered me to do anything, I did it. If
he called me names, I did not retort upon him. It
galled me sorely to permit the puppy to ride over
me in this manner; to be insulted, kicked, and
cuffed at his royal pleasure; but while it was simply
a sacrifice of personal pride, or even of self-respect,
it did not so much matter. When, however,
Waddie and his father wished to brand me as a
criminal, and to browbeat me because I would not
confess myself guilty of a deed in which I had no
hand, my nature revolted. In my indignation, I
had made use of some expressions which I had
better not have used, and which I should not have
used if I had not been suffering under the weight
of that sad day’s trials.</p>

<p>I did not care for myself under the displeasure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the mighty man. My mother was a timid woman,
and the cloud of misfortunes which was rising over
us filled her with dismay. The displeasure of Colonel
Wimpleton, the loss of the money, and above
all the fear that my father would return to his old
habits, were terrors enough for one day, and I wept
for her. But what could I do? To confess myself
guilty of a crime when I was innocent was the
greatest wrong I could do to her and to myself. I
would not do that, whatever else I did; and there
was no other way to win back the favor of the
colonel.</p>

<p>After I had cooled off, I returned to the house,
and found my mother more calm than I expected.
She had resumed her work; but she looked very
sad and troubled. My two sisters had gone to the
village, and as yet knew nothing of the misfortunes
that were settling down upon our house.</p>

<p>“Wolfert, I am sorry you were so rash,” said my
mother, as I seated myself in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I am sorry myself; but I don’t think it would
have made any difference with the colonel if I had
been as gentle as a lamb,” I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it would.”</p>

<p>“The colonel wished me to take upon my shoulders
the blame, or part of it, of blowing up the
canal boat. Nothing less than that would have satisfied
them. You can’t wonder that I was mad, after
what you heard him say to me. I have eaten dirt
before the colonel and his son for years, and I don’t
think we have made anything by it; but whether
we have or not, I won’t be called a villain and a
scoundrel, or confess a thing I didn’t do.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wimpleton is a very powerful man in Centreport,”
added my mother, shaking her head in
deprecation of any rash steps.</p>

<p>“I know he is, mother; and I will do anything
I can to please him, except sell my own soul; and
he hasn’t got money enough to buy that. I’m not
going to put my nose into the dirt for him.”</p>

<p>“He may ruin us, Wolfert.”</p>

<p>“What can he do?”</p>

<p>“He can discharge your father.”</p>

<p>“Father can get as much wages in another place
as he can here. Perhaps he will be wanted on the
Ruoara, now Christy has run away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p>“But his house is here, and he meant to stay in
Centreport. Besides, Mr. Wimpleton can turn us
out of the house if we don’t pay the money, which
will be due in a few days.”</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Mortimer will catch Christy, and
get the money. If he don’t, there is a man in town
who offered thirty-five hundred dollars for the place;
and that is more than it cost, and father won’t lose
anything.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Mr. Wimpleton, Wolfert. He
is a terrible man when he is offended. If the place
were sold at auction, as it would be, he has influence
enough to prevent any one from bidding on it;
and your father might lose every cent he has left
in the world.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do, mother?” I asked,
rising from my chair, considerably excited. “Shall
I say that I helped Waddie blow up the canal
boat?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not, Wolfert, unless you did help
him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I did, mother?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t think so, after what you have said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>“I had nothing more to do with it than you
had.”</p>

<p>“But you can be a little more gentle with him.”</p>

<p>“And let him browbeat and bully me as much
as he pleases? I think, mother, if I stand up squarely
for my own rights, he will respect me all the
more. For my own part, I am about tired of Centreport,
for all the people bow down and toady
to Colonel Wimpleton. If he takes snuff, everybody
sneezes. All the fellows treat Waddie as
though he was a prince of the blood. I have been
ashamed and disgusted with myself a hundred times
after I have let him bully me and put his foot on
my neck. I have been tempted to thrash him, a
dozen times, for his impudence; and if I didn’t do
so, it was not because I didn’t want to.”</p>

<p>“You must try to have a Christian spirit, Wolfert,”
said the mother, mildly.</p>

<p>“I do try to have a Christian spirit, mother. I
haven’t anything against Waddie or his father. If
I could do a kindness to either one of them this
minute, I would do it. But I don’t think a fellow
must be a milksop in order to be a Christian. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
don’t think the gospel requires me to be a toady,
or even to submit to injustice when I can help myself.
I don’t ask to be revenged, or anything of
that sort; I only desire to keep my head out of the
dirt. I am going to try to be a man, whatever happens
to me.”</p>

<p>“If you will only be a Christian, Wolfert, I can
ask no more.”</p>

<p>“I will try to be; but do you think yourself,
mother, that I ought to stand still and allow myself
to be kicked?”</p>

<p>“You must not provoke your enemies.”</p>

<p>“I will not, if I can help it; but I think it is
pretty hard to keep still when you are called a rascal
and a villain. If you think I ought to confess
that I helped blow up the canal boat when I did
not, I will”—</p>

<p>I was going to say I would do it, but the words
choked me, and I could not utter them.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish you to say so, Wolfert.”</p>

<p>“Then I am satisfied; and I will try to be gentle
while they abuse me.”</p>

<p>At this moment Waddie Wimpleton bolted into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the room, without taking the trouble to announce
himself beforehand.</p>

<p>“My father says you must come up and see him
at once,” said the scion in his usual bullying and
offensive tone.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” I asked, as quietly as I could
speak, under the influence of my good mother’s
lesson.</p>

<p>“At the house. Where do you suppose he is?”
pouted Waddie. “And he says, if you don’t come,
he’ll send a constable after you.”</p>

<p>“What does he want of me?”</p>

<p>“None of your business what he wants. All
you’ve got to do is to go.”</p>

<p>“If I conclude to go, I will be there in a few
moments,” I added.</p>

<p>“If you conclude to go!” exclaimed Waddie.
“Well, that is cool! Do you mean to say you
won’t go?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean to say that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to know whether you are going
or not,” demanded the scion.</p>

<p>“Shall I go, mother?” I asked, appealing to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>“I think you had better go, Wolfert.”</p>

<p>“Then I will go.”</p>

<p>“You had better,” continued Waddie, who could
not help bullying even after his point was gained.</p>

<p>The gentlemanly young man left the house, and my
mother admonished me again not to be saucy, and
to return good for evil. I hoped I should be able
to do so. If I failed, it would not be for the want
of a good intention. I walked up the road towards
the mansion of the great man, thinking what I
should say, and how I could best defend myself
from the charge which was again to be urged
against me. The situation looked very hopeless
to me as I jumped over the fence in the grove,
through which there was a path which led to the
house of the colonel.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” said Waddie, accompanying the
remark with a yell not unlike an Indian war-whoop.</p>

<p>I halted and turned around. Behind me stood
the scion of the great house of Centreport, with a
club in his hand, and attended by half a dozen of
the meanest fellows of the Institute, armed in like
manner. They had been concealed behind the fence;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and of course I instantly concluded that the colonel’s
message was a mere trick to decoy me into
the grove.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to see me?” I asked as coolly as
I could; and the circumstances under which we
appeared to meet were not favorable to a frigid
demeanor.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to see you,” replied Waddie, moving
up to me, and flourishing his stick. “You must
settle my account before you see my governor.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of me?” I demanded, as I
edged up to a big tree, which would protect me
from an assault in the rear.</p>

<p>“You told my father I was the biggest liar in
town,” blustered Waddie. “I’m going to give you
the biggest licking for it you ever had in your life.”</p>

<p>“Go in, Waddie!” shouted Sam Peppers. “We’ll
stand by, and see fair play.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready to take your licking?” bullied
Waddie, who did not seem to be quite ready to commence
the operation.</p>

<p>“No, I am not,” I answered, quietly; and I never
spoke truer words in my life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p>“You called me the biggest liar in town—didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to say about it?”</p>

<p>“I have,” I replied, still moved by the gentle
words of gospel wisdom which my mother had
spoken to me.</p>

<p>“If you have, say it quick.”</p>

<p>“I was angry when I spoke the words, and I am
sorry for uttering them.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! humph!” yelled the half-dozen ruffians
in concert.</p>

<p>“Get down on your knees and beg my pardon,
then,” said Waddie.</p>

<p>“No, I will not do that,” I replied, firmly.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>WOLF’S FORTRESS.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>Under the influence of the better thoughts
which my good mother had suggested to me,
I was willing to do better deeds. I was ready to
apologize; I had done so, but I could not go down
upon my knees before such a fellow as Waddie Wimpleton,
or any fellow, for that matter. It was hard
enough for me to say I was sorry; and I had done
so for my mother’s sake, rather than my own.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are very sorry for what you
said,” sneered Waddie.</p>

<p>“I am sorry enough to apologize. I really regret
that I made use of any hard expressions,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then get down on your knees, and beg my
pardon, as I tell you,” persisted Waddie, flourishing
his stick. “If you do, I’ll let you off on part of the
punishment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<p>“I apologized because I had done wrong, and not
because I was afraid of the punishment,” I added,
still schooling my tongue to gentle speech.</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the scion; and my remark
was based on a philosophy so subtle that he could
not comprehend it.</p>

<p>“Go in! Go in! Give it to him!” shouted the
supporting ruffians. “He’s fooling you, Waddie.”</p>

<p>“If you are not going to do what I tell you, look
out for the consequences,” blustered the young gentleman,
who still seemed to have some doubts in
regard to the prudence of his present conduct.</p>

<p>“Waddie Wimpleton,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want now?” demanded he,
dropping his weapon again.</p>

<p>“If you strike me with that stick, you must look
out for consequences. I shall defend myself as well
as I know how.”</p>

<p>Waddie glanced at his companions.</p>

<p>“Hit him! What are you waiting for?” cried his
friends; and I have always observed, in such cases,
that it is easier to give advice than to strike the
blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Waddie had placed himself in a position which
he could not well evacuate. He evidently had no
heart for the encounter which he foresaw must take
place if he struck me, and perhaps he had not entire
confidence in the character of the support which he
was to receive. At any rate he could not help realizing
that the first blows of the battle were likely
to be dealt upon his own head.</p>

<p>“You called me a liar,” said he, working up his
courage again by a new recital of his wrongs.</p>

<p>“I did, and apologized for it,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Go down on your knees, then, and say you are
sorry.”</p>

<p>“I will not.”</p>

<p>“Then mind your eye,” continued Waddie, as
with a sudden spring he hit me on the arm, which
I had raised to ward off the blow.</p>

<p>I did mind my eye, and I minded his, too; for,
before he could bring up his supports, I leaped upon
him. Though he was of my own size and age, he
was only a baby in my hands. I grasped his stick,
wrenched and twisted it a few times, and then threw
him over backwards into a pool of soft mud, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
I had chosen to flank my position and save me from
an attack in the rear. He was half buried in the
soft compound of black mud and decayed leaves
which filled the hole, and his good clothes suffered
severely from the effects of his disaster.</p>

<p>The moment the conflict commenced the supports
moved up; but, before they could come into action,
I had overthrown my assailant, and stood against
the tree with the club in my hand. When Waddie
went over backwards, a new duty seemed to be suggested
to his backers; and, instead of turning on me,
they proceeded to help their principal out of his
uncomfortable position. Encouraged and thoroughly
waked up by my victory, I think I could have
thrashed the whole party; but I had not wholly
escaped the influence of my mother’s teachings, and
was disposed to act strictly in self-defence.</p>

<p>The quagmire into which Waddie had fallen was
near the bank of the brook which meandered through
the grove, and which had been bridged in several
places, as well to add to the convenience of passers-by,
as to increase the picturesque beauty of the place.
I deemed it best to retreat to one of these bridges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
which was not more than three feet wide, and which
would enable me to defend myself from an assault
to the best advantage.</p>

<p>“Humph! you cowards!” snarled Waddie, as his
companions lifted him out of the slough, and he spit
out the mud and water which filled his mouth.
“Why didn’t you stand by me, as you promised?”</p>

<p>“We expected you to make a better fight than
that,” replied one of them; and it was doubtful to
me whether they could assign any good reason why
they had not stood by him.</p>

<p>“I did the best I could, and you did not come
near me. I’m in a pretty pickle,” sputtered Waddie,
as he glanced at his soiled garments.</p>

<p>“We’ll give it to him yet,” said one of the party,
as he glanced at me securely posted on the bridge.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Waddie.</p>

<p>I was pointed out to him, and the sight of me
inflamed all his zeal again.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows; and stand by me this time, I
wish I had my revolver here.”</p>

<p>I was very glad he had not that formidable weapon
about him, though I don’t think he could have hit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
me if he had fired at me; but he sometimes struck
the mark by accident. Waddie took a club from the
hand of one of his supporters, and rushed towards
the bridge. Though he was not a master of strategy,
he could not help seeing that I was well posted, and
he halted suddenly before he reached the brook.</p>

<p>“We must drive him from the bridge, where we
can have fair play,” said Waddie.</p>

<p>I did not just then see how this was to be done;
but I was soon able to perceive his plan. The scion
led his forces to a position on the brook above me,
and, taking some stones from the shallow stream,
began to pelt me with a vigor which soon rendered
my place untenable. Several of the missiles hit me,
though I was not much hurt by them. Under these
circumstances, I was helpless for defensive purposes,
for I had nothing with which to return the fire. It
was useless for me to stand there, and be peppered
with stones. I concluded to retreat in good order,
and brought myself off without any material damage.</p>

<figure class='figcenter' id='i_133'>

  <figcaption>WOLF’S FORTRESS.—<a href='#Page_133'>Page 133</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The only safe line by which I could retire was in
the direction of the mansion of Colonel Wimpleton.
I crossed the brook farther down, and came to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
rustic summer house, on the bank of the stream.
It was built on a high foundation, to afford a prospect
of the lake, and the only admission was through
the door, which was reached by a long flight of
steps. I immediately took possession of this structure,
assured that I could defend the door, while its
walls would protect me from the missiles of my
assailants.</p>

<p>Waddie led his forces up to my fortress, and surveyed
the situation. They attempted to drive me
out with stones; but they fell harmless upon the
building. The besiegers consulted together, and
decided to make an assault on the works. I was
entirely willing they should do so, for I could knock
them over with the club as fast as they came up,
having all the advantage of position. Ben Pinkerton
volunteered to lead the forlorn hope, and advanced
with considerable boldness to the attack. I gave
him a gentle rap on the head as he appeared at the
door, and he fell back, unable to reach me with his
stick, as I stood so much higher than he.</p>

<p>“Better keep back,” I remonstrated with him.
“If there are any broken heads, they will be yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<p>Dick Bayard then attempted to climb up the
railing of the stairs, so as to be on a level with
me; but I knocked his fingers with my stick, and
he desisted. It was plain to them, after this trial,
that a direct assault was not practicable, and they
retired to the ground below. Another consultation
followed in the ranks of the enemy; and by this
time Waddie’s friends were quite as much interested
in the affair as he was himself.</p>

<p>“I wish I had my revolver,” said the scion. “Hold
on! I will go to the house and get it; you stay
here, and don’t let him come down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! We don’t want any pistol,” protested
Ben Pinkerton. “You mustn’t shoot him!”</p>

<p>“Why not? I would shoot him as quick as I
would a cat. I wouldn’t kill him, of course; but I
would make him come down, and give us fair play
on the ground,” added Waddie.</p>

<p>Fair play! Seven of them, armed with clubs,
against one! That was Waddie’s idea of fair play.</p>

<p>“No; we don’t want any pistols,” persisted Ben.
“Some one might get hurt, and then we should be
in a bad scrape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” demanded the
young gentleman. “Are you going to let him stay
up there and crow over us? I’m wet through, and I
don’t want to stay here all day. I’ll tell you what
I’ll do. I’ll set the summer house on fire. That will
bring him down.”</p>

<p>This was a brilliant idea of Waddie, and I was
afraid he would put it into operation, for he was
reckless enough to do anything.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” replied the prudent Pinkerton.
“We don’t want to get into any scrape.”</p>

<p>“No; don’t set it on fire,” added Dick Bayard;
and so said all of them but Waddie; for probably
they foresaw that they would have to bear all the
blame of the deed.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to stay here all day,” fretted Waddie.</p>

<p>“Put it through by daylight!” I ventured to suggest,
as I sat on the upper step, listening to the
interview.</p>

<p>“He is laughing at us,” said the scion, angrily.</p>

<p>“Let him laugh; he is safe,” replied Ben. “I’ll
tell you what we can do.”</p>

<p>“Well, what?” asked Waddie, as he cast a discontented
glance at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>“Let us camp out here to-night,” continued Ben.</p>

<p>“Camp out!” repeated several of the party, not
fully comprehending the idea of the fertile Pinkerton’s
brilliant mind.</p>

<p>“Starve him out, I mean,” explained Ben. “We
will stay here and keep him a close prisoner till he
is willing to come down and take his licking like
a man.”</p>

<p>Stupid as this plan seemed to me, it was promptly
adopted. But the enemy retired out of hearing to
complete the arrangement, though they were near
enough to fall upon me if I attempted to escape.
I did not consider myself a match for the whole of
them on the ground, and I had expected to be terribly
mauled, as I should have been if my wits had
not served me well.</p>

<p>Presently I saw Waddie leave the party, and walk
towards his father’s house. I concluded that he had
gone to change his clothes, for his plight was as
disagreeable as it could be. His companions took
position near the foot of the steps, with the clubs
in their hands, ready to receive me if I attempted
to evacuate my fortress. I was quite comfortable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and rather curious to know what they intended
to do.</p>

<p>I waited an hour for the return of Waddie, during
which time I studied the structure in which I was a
prisoner, and its surroundings, in order to prepare
myself for action when it should be necessary. It
was plain to me that the scion was taking more
time than was needed to change his clothes. I
thought something had happened at the house; and
in this impression I was soon confirmed by the appearance
of Colonel Wimpleton, attended by two
men.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>CAPTAIN SYNDERS.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>There were not many men in Centreport who
were not either the toadies or the employees
of Colonel Wimpleton. He was an absolute monarch
in the place, and his will was law, to all intents
and purposes, though of course he did not
operate with all as he did with me. Ordinarily,
and especially when not opposed, he was a very
gentlemanly man, affable to his equals,—if he had
any equals in town,—and condescending to his
inferiors.</p>

<p>I was not quite willing to believe that Waddie
had called upon his father for aid. It was more
probable that the scion’s dirty plight had attracted
the attention of his parents, and called forth an
explanation. But it was all the same to me, since
Colonel Wimpleton was coming with efficient aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
to capture and reduce me to proper subjection. It
was no common enemy with whom I was called
upon to contend, but the mighty man of Centreport,
whose will none dared to oppose.</p>

<p>As the party approached, I saw that one of the
men was Captain Synders, the ex-skipper of a canal
boat, who had been promoted to the honors and
dignities of a constable. I was somewhat appalled
when I considered his official position, for he was
armed with authority, and it would be hardly safe
for me to offer any resistance to him. The coming
of Colonel Wimpleton nipped in the bud the scheme
of the bullies to camp out around me, and I was
rather glad to have the case settled without any
unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>The summer house, which was a poor imitation
of an Indian pagoda, mounted on piles, had a door,
with a window in each of its octagonal faces. On
the other side of the brook was a large tree, whose
branches partially shaded the building. During my
study of the situation, I had arranged a plan by
which my escape could be effected at a favorable
moment. I could pass out at one of the windows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and climb to the roof of the pagoda, from which
the overhanging branches of the trees would afford
me the means of reaching the ground. The only
difficulty in my way was, that my besiegers would
be able to reach the foot of the tree before I could,
and thus cut off my retreat. But the summer house
was located near the lake, and the brook at this
point was wide and deep, so that it could not be
crossed except on the bridge, which was several
rods distant. My line of retreat would be available
only when the besiegers were off their guard,
or were not in a situation to pursue instantly.</p>

<p>When Colonel Wimpleton appeared, Waddie’s six
brave companions retired from the ground, fearful,
perhaps, of getting into a scrape. I saw them move
off a short distance, and halt to observe the proceedings.
The great man and his associates devoted
their whole attention to me, and did not
heed the students. They came directly to the foot
of the stairs, while I sat at the head of them. I
had made a movement to retire when the valiant
six retreated; but I saw that the attempt would only
throw me into the hands of the reënforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>“Come down, you villain!” called Colonel Wimpleton,
as he halted at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>To this summons to surrender I made no reply.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by knocking my son over
into the mud?” he added, angrily.</p>

<p>“He began it upon me, sir,” I replied. “He
brought up half a dozen fellows to lick me, and
struck me with a club.”</p>

<p>“He served you right. I told you to come
down.”</p>

<p>“I know you did, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you coming down?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet.”</p>

<p>“Go up and bring him down, Synders,” said the
colonel to the officer.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring him down,” replied the zealous constable.</p>

<p>But he did not.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, leaped out upon the trimmings
of the pagoda, and vaulted to the roof
almost in the twinkling of an eye—at any rate,
before Captain Synders reached the inside of the
summer house. The constable looked out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
window at my elevated position. He was too
clumsy to follow me, and I felt that I was perfectly
safe. From the roof I saw that the branches
of the tree were more favorable to my descent
than I had supposed, and I found that I could
climb into another tree on the same side of the
brook as the pagoda. I jumped into the branches
of this tree, and began to move down. I found
that my gymnastic practice at the Institute, where
I had excelled in this department, was of great
service to me, and I was quite sure that no man
could follow me.</p>

<p>Perching myself on a branch, I paused to examine
the situation again. Captain Synders sent the
man who had come with him, and who was one
of the gardeners, to the foot of the tree to intercept
my retreat. I did not purpose to go down
that way, but intended, at the right time, to return
to the roof of the pagoda, and descend on the other
side of the brook. My movement in this direction
was only a feint. The colonel expected, doubtless,
that I would drop down into the arms of the gardener,
and that the chase would be immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
ended; but, seated on the branch, I kept still, and
said nothing.</p>

<p>“Are you going down, you scoundrel?” roared the
colonel, when he found the plan did not work.</p>

<p>“No, sir, not yet.”</p>

<p>“You are on my grounds, and I will have you
arrested as a trespasser,” foamed the colonel.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, sir, and I came at your request.”</p>

<p>“Who sent for you?”</p>

<p>“You did, sir; ask Waddie; he was your messenger.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t send for you.”</p>

<p>“Waddie came to my house, and said you wanted
to see me.”</p>

<p>“I want to see you now, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Here I am, sir.”</p>

<p>“You shall be punished for knocking my son over
into the mud.”</p>

<p>“I would like to talk this matter over coolly,
Colonel Wimpleton,” I continued, taking an easy
position in the tree, “I apologized to Waddie for
calling him a liar, and I am sorry I was saucy to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span></p>

<p>“Humph! Come down from that tree, then. If
you make a clean breast of it, I will let you off
easy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m to blame for anything except
being saucy,” I replied; and I did not think I was
much to blame for that, after he had called me a
villain and a scoundrel, and other hard names; still
it was returning evil for evil.</p>

<p>“Did he apologize to you, Waddie?” asked the
colonel, turning to his hopeful.</p>

<p>“He said he was sorry, and I told him to get
down on his knees and beg my pardon,” replied
Waddie.</p>

<p>“And he would not do it?” asked the indignant
father, evidently regarding it as exceedingly unreasonable
in me to refuse to undergo this trifling
humiliation.</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the great man. “We shall
see whether he will or not.”</p>

<p>I was willing to see.</p>

<p>“Wolf Penniman, you are a bad boy!” exclaimed
the colonel with emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span></p>

<p>I did not dispute him.</p>

<p>“You have insulted me and my son.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to be forgiven, sir,” I answered,
after a vain effort to keep down the spirit which
was rising in me. “I have apologized for being
saucy; what more can I do?”</p>

<p>“You must do what my son told you to do, and
then confess that you helped blow up the canal
boat,” replied he, more calmly than he had yet
spoken.</p>

<p>“I can’t do anything more, then. I know nothing
about the blow-up, and I won’t go down on
my knees to anybody in this world.”</p>

<p>“You are an obstinate villain, and I’ll bring you
to your senses before I have done with you. Where
is your father?”</p>

<p>“Gone to Hitaca.”</p>

<p>“Will you come down now, or shall I have you
brought down?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be brought down, if it’s all the same to you,
sir,” I replied, folding my arms, and looking as impudent
as I spoke.</p>

<p>I felt that I had given my mother’s good advice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
a fair trial. I had gained nothing by apologizing,
though I was not sorry I had done so. The more
I humiliated myself, the more I must; and, without
meaning to be saucy, I determined to stand up
squarely for my own rights and my own dignity.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring him down, if you say so, father,” volunteered
the Wimpleton junior.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“We can drive him out of the tree, as we did
off the bridge.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so!” exclaimed Captain Synders. “That’s
a good idea. Since neither words nor grass will do,
we’ll try what virtue’s in a stone or two.”</p>

<p>The besiegers went down the stairs, and Waddie
called up his forces, ready to renew the assault. By
the time they reached the ground, I had descended
to the roof of the pagoda, where the party could
not see me, and where the thick branches of the
trees protected me from their missiles. They soon
found they were not getting ahead any, and by
the advice of Synders they changed their position.
With the exception of the colonel, who was too
dignified to throw stones, men and boys renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the assault, and poured a shower of stones upon
me. Some of them hit me, and the roof became
too warm for me. I dropped down into the summer
house for safety. Finding the coast clear,—for
the colonel had been forced to retire from the foot
of the stairs to avoid the stones,—I rushed down
the steps, and ran with all my might towards home.
The besiegers had been careless, and I was only too
happy to take advantage of their mistake.</p>

<p>I ran as fast as I could over the bridge, following
the path by which I had come. I was closely
pursued; but I distanced all my enemies. It would
be useless for me to go home; for the constable
was a man of authority, and I supposed he had
been sent for to arrest me, though on what charge
I could not conjecture, for Wimpleton senior would
not dare to prosecute me in a matter wherein Wimpleton
junior would be likely to suffer more than
myself. I wished to spare my mother the pain
and anxiety of another controversy in the house;
and for that reason, as well as because home was
not a safe place for me, I made my way to the
mill wharf, where I had an old skiff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span></p>

<p>I reached this boat without accident, but out of
breath with the hard run I had had. Jumping in,
I pushed off, and pulled away from the shore. For
the present I was safe, for there was no boat in
which I could be pursued, nearer than the mansion
of Colonel Wimpleton. The constable and his companions
did not come down to the wharf after
they saw me push off, but returned in the direction
of the grove. I rowed out upon the lake,
where I could see any boat which might put off
after me. I went half way across the lake, and
then concluded that my assailants had chosen to wait
for my return.</p>

<p>I did not exactly like to return then; it would
only be putting my head into the lion’s mouth;
and I pulled for Middleport. A sail-boat was near
me, in which were several boys, one of whom presently
hailed me.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Wolf?” called the speaker, in whom
I recognized Tommy Toppleton.</p>

<p>I informed him that it was I.</p>

<p>“I was going over after you,” he added. “Jump
aboard—will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<p>I did so, and was glad to find myself among
friends, though they were Toppletonians.</p>

<p>“We want you to get that engine out of the
water,” continued Tommy.</p>

<p>I saw the tow-boat at the wharf, with steam up,
and I promised to do the job before night—in fact,
to put it through by daylight.</p>

<p class='chap-title'>RAISING THE DUMMY.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>“Haven’t you any one in Middleport that
can raise that engine?” I asked, with a
pleasant smile, after I had taken a seat in Tommy
Toppleton’s beautiful sail-boat, with my old skiff in
tow.</p>

<p>“Of course we have,” replied the Toppleton
junior; “but I’m afraid it will take a week for them
to do it. They are talking about rigging a derrick
on the wharf.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need any derrick, or anything of that
sort,” I added, confidently; and I was quite satisfied
that with the aid of the tow-boat I could make
good my promise.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can really raise the thing?”
asked Tommy, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I know I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span></p>

<p>“Can you do it right up quick?”</p>

<p>“It may take an hour or so. Can I have your
father’s tow-boat?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you can; but my father don’t know I
came over after you,” added the scion of the house
of Toppleton.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to do anything without your
father’s knowledge and consent.”</p>

<p>“He won’t find any fault with anything except
that you are a Centreporter.”</p>

<p>“I am no more a Centreporter than I am a Middleporter
now,” I replied. “I have had a row with
the powers that be on our side.”</p>

<p>“A row! Good!” exclaimed Tommy, his face
brightening up at this intelligence. “What was it?”</p>

<p>I explained what it was, telling the whole history
of the blowing up of the canal-boat, with the collateral
incidents relating to the affair.</p>

<p>“That’s just like Wimpleton,” said Tommy. “We
don’t behave in that way on our side of the lake.”</p>

<p>I hoped they did not; but it was a fact patent
to the people, that Mr. Tommy, though by no
means as bad a boy as Waddie, was a spoiled child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
He was overbearing, domineering, and inclined to
get into bad scrapes. Though he was willing to be
my friend, and to treat me with the greatest consideration
at the present time, it was only because he
had an axe to grind; and I had not much confidence
in the professions he made to me.</p>

<p>“I wish you would come and live on our side,”
added Tommy. “We want just such a fellow as
you are over here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may have to live over here,” I replied.
“I suppose Waddie will not let me rest in
peace after what has happened; and I never will
go down on my knees to him or any other person.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Wolf,” said Tommy, warmly.
“If you want a dozen or twenty of our fellows
to go over and whip out the crowd that set upon
you, we will do it—won’t we, fellows?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet we will,” replied the half dozen particular
cronies of Tommy who were in the boat with
him.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to do anything of that kind. I
bear Waddie no ill will; and if he will only let me
alone, I shall never have any trouble with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span></p>

<p>“You are too easy with him. If you only licked
him once, he would respect you for it.”</p>

<p>I could not help thinking what the consequences
would be if any plebeian Middleporter took it into
his head to “lick” Tommy Toppleton; and it was
about the same on one side of the lake as the other.
It was not prudent to thrash so much pride, conceit,
and wealth, as were embodied in the person of either
of the heirs of the great houses. The sons of poor
men had to stand back, and take off their hats to
the scion of either family. Fathers’ situations and
mothers’ social positions depended much upon the
deference paid by their children to the representatives
of the nabobs.</p>

<p>“Where shall I land you, Wolf?” asked Tommy,
as the sail-boat approached the wharf, near which
the dummy reposed, ignominiously, on the bottom
of the lake.</p>

<p>“Put me on board of the tow-boat, if you please.
And you must get the captain to do what I tell him,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“I’ll do that. He shall obey your orders just as
though you were the owner of the steamer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<p>We ran up to the tow-boat, which was about to
start on a trip up the lake with a fleet of canal
boats that had gathered together. I knew that she
had on board all the rigging I needed for my bold
experiment, including some very long tow-lines.
Tommy ran up to the boat, and he and I leaped
upon her deck, for I had assured him I needed no
help from the boys, or any one else.</p>

<p>“Captain Underwood, we want to use your boat
for a while,” said Tommy, as briskly as though he
had himself been the owner of the craft.</p>

<p>“Does your father say so?” asked the captain,
with some hesitation, and with the utmost deference.</p>

<p>“No matter whether he does or not; I will be
responsible. Now go ahead, Wolf. You can put
her through by daylight.”</p>

<p>The captain consented to take part in the enterprise,
when informed that I was the “young engineer,”—as
I had the honor to be called,—and
that I had a plan to put the dummy on shore.</p>

<p>“Shall I explain the plan to you, Captain Underwood?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“No, you needn’t, Wolf, unless you wish to do
so,” interposed Tommy, impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>“If you will tell me what to do, I will obey
orders,” answered the captain. “In fact, I don’t
care to know anything about it; and then I shall
be responsible for nothing.”</p>

<p>“All right, captain. You shall not be responsible,
and if I fail no harm will be done. Have you
a stout iron hook?”</p>

<p>“Yes; here is one on the end of this tow-line,”
he replied, pointing to a coil of large rope.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want,” said I, throwing off
my coat. “Now run up to the north side of the
dummy.”</p>

<p>Before the steamer reached the spot I had thrown
off all my clothes. Jumping into my skiff with
Tommy, who was proud and happy to have a finger
in the pie, we took the tow-line on board, and pulled
to the end of the dummy, to which I made fast. I
had ascertained from my companion that there was
a shackle eye in each end of the engine, by which
another car could be attached to it; and my present
purpose was to fasten the hook into this eye.</p>

<p>The water of Lake Ucayga is as clear as crystal,
and I had no trouble in finding the eye, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
no more than four feet below the surface of the lake.
I dropped down into the engine-room, standing up
to my neck in water, and Tommy lowered down
the iron hook. I then stooped down, disappeared
from the view of the world above me for a moment,
and attached the hook to the eye.</p>

<p>“All right, Tommy,” said I, when I had cleared
the water from my mouth.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Wolf; but I don’t see how you
are going to put the thing on shore,” replied he.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it; if I don’t I never will go
on shore again myself,” I added, as I sprang upon
the roof of the dummy again.</p>

<p>“I should hate to fail, for the fellows are a-gathering
on the wharf to see the fun.”</p>

<p>“There’s no such word as fail,” I answered, leaping
into the boat. “Now pull for the tow-boat, and
let me put on my rags again.”</p>

<p>I jumped upon deck, and in a few moments had
my clothes on. I glanced at the wharf, and saw
that quite a number of students and grown-up people
had gathered there, as the intelligence spread that
something was going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p>“What next, Wolf?” asked Captain Underwood,
bestowing upon me a smile which seemed to indicate
an utter want of confidence in my operations.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, captain,” I replied, seizing the tow-line,
and making it fast at the bits provided for the
purpose.</p>

<p>I knew what the bottom of the lake was at the
Middleport wharf, for I had been down there more
than once. It was composed of hard gravel, and
almost as smooth as the surface of the lake in a
calm day. I knew that the flanges of the car wheels
would cut into the ground and make it go hard
and they would run as well there as on a hard
road.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” said Captain Underwood to the
engineer.</p>

<p>“Steady, captain! Work her up gradually,” I
added.</p>

<p>The wheels turned slowly at first, so as not to
part the tow-line, or needlessly wrench the sunken
car; but in a few moments she had full steam on.
It was an anxious moment to me, and the gathering
crowd on shore watched the movement in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<p>“She starts!” exclaimed Tommy, highly excited.
“She’s coming!”</p>

<p>“Of course she’s coming; I knew she would,” I
replied, struggling to keep down the emotions which
agitated me.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Tommy, as the dummy began
to follow us, as though she were a part of the
steamer.</p>

<p>“Starboard your helm, Captain Underwood,” I
called.</p>

<p>“Starboard it is,” replied the captain, when he
had given the order to the wheelman.</p>

<p>“Keep as well in shore as your draught will let
you,” I continued.</p>

<p>“I can’t run the boat up on the shore, Wolf,”
said the captain.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to do so. The dummy travels
very well on the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but we can’t drag it out of the water without
running upon shore with the boat.”</p>

<p>“I think we can, captain. At any rate, don’t let
the boat get aground,” I replied.</p>

<p>The steamer continued on her course till she came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
abreast of a large tree growing on the shore, between
which and the lake the rails were laid down.</p>

<p>“Stop her!” I shouted; and my order was
promptly obeyed.</p>

<p>The dummy was now in about six feet of water,
and not more than a hundred feet from the tree.
It was headed in a diagonal towards the railroad.</p>

<p>“Now, Captain Underwood, have you a heavy
snatch-block?” I asked as the boat stopped.</p>

<p>“I have—one used with that tow-line,” replied
the obliging captain, to whom the request indicated
the nature of further operations; and I ought to add,
in justice to him, that the look of incredulity which
had played upon his face was all gone.</p>

<p>I took the snatch-block, with the ropes to make it
fast, and the end of the tow-line, into the skiff, and,
attended by Tommy, pulled ashore. My companion,
in spite of the fact that he usually wore kid gloves,
made himself exceedingly serviceable. I rigged the
snatch-block to the tree, and passed the tow-line
over the sheaf, carrying the end back to the steamer
in the boat, where I made it fast to the stern bits.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, captain!” I called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p>Working her up to her speed slowly and carefully,
the steamer ploughed and strained for a few moments,
then went ahead. The rope strained, but it
did not part, and the dummy walked up out of the
water as though she had been a sea-horse emerging
from his native element.</p>

<p>The crowd which had followed the steamer cheered
lustily, and my promise was redeemed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>GETTING UP STEAM.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>The enthusiastic cheering which followed the
passage of the dummy from the water to the
land was grateful to me, and I enjoyed it to a degree
which I cannot express. I felt just as though
the Centreporters had cast me out, and the Middleporters
had taken me up. I was quite confident
that there were many persons in Middleport who
could have raised the dummy; but no one seemed
to have thought of my plan. Perhaps few of them
knew the bottom of the lake as well as I did, for
diving was one of my accomplishments; and I had
oftener gone into the water on the Middleport side
than on the other, because the beach was better.</p>

<p>“By gracious, Wolf! you have done it!” exclaimed
Tommy Toppleton, as I directed the captain
to stop the steamer; and his mouth and his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
were opened as wide as if an earthquake had rent
the lake beneath us.</p>

<p>“Of course I have done it; I expected to do it,”
I replied, as indifferently as I could, for, however big
one may feel, he does not always like to show it.</p>

<p>“You have done it handsomely, too,” added Captain
Underwood; and praise from Sir What’s-his-name
was praise indeed.</p>

<p>“I hope the Wimpleton fellows saw that,” said
Tommy, puffing out his cheeks, and looking as grand
as an alderman. “It would take them down a peg
if they did.”</p>

<p>“I expect to catch it for helping you out,” I added,
as I thought of the wrath of Colonel Wimpleton,
when he should hear that I had been playing into
the hands of the Toppletonians.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be afraid of the whole boodle of
them,” replied Tommy, shaking his head, as though
he thought the other side would make a great mistake
if it attempted to punish me for what I had
done.</p>

<p>“We’ll talk about that some other time,” I answered,
turning my attention to business again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>“We haven’t quite done the work yet. We must
put the dummy on the track.”</p>

<p>“Can I help you any more?” asked the captain,
with a deference which amazed me.</p>

<p>“You may give us one more pull, if you are not
in a hurry. I’m going on shore now, and I will
make a signal to start and to stop her, with my
handkerchief,” said I, jumping into the skiff with
Tommy.</p>

<p>The dummy stood within a couple of rods of the
track, which was in readiness as far as Spangleport,
five miles down the lake. We landed, and marched
in triumph through the crowd of men and boys on
the shore, though I ought to say that Tommy did
the triumphal part of the programme, and looked as
grand as though he had himself been the engineer
of the movement. Scores of the students offered
their services, and as I was on the point of sending
some of them for a few planks on which to roll the
dummy to the track, a platform car, which had constituted
the entire rolling stock of the Lake Shore
Railroad, rumbled up to the spot, in charge of a portion
of the students, attended by Major Toppleton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
himself. The car was loaded with planks and rigging,
which the Middleport magnate had foreseen we
should want.</p>

<p>“We’ve got her out, father!” shouted Tommy,
when he saw the major.</p>

<p>“I see you have,” replied the great man, with a
cheerful smile.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t quite finished the job yet,” added
the young gentleman, bustling about as though the
completion of the work rested heavily on his shoulders.
“What next, Wolf?” said he, turning to me,
and speaking in a lower tone.</p>

<p>“We must lay down some planks to roll it on the
track with,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Bring up the planks, fellows!” cried Tommy;
and the students rushed to obey his commands.</p>

<p>“This is Wolf—is it?” said Major Toppleton,
bestowing a patronizing glance at me.</p>

<p>“Yes, father; this is Wolf, and he puts things
through by daylight, I can tell you. He and I have
managed this thing ourselves,” replied Tommy, swelling
with importance.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Wolf. They say you have
a taste for machinery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I’m very fond of machinery.”</p>

<p>“And you live on the other side?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; my father is the engineer in Colonel
Wimpleton’s steam mill.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated the major. “But you have
done well, for I was just offering a man two hundred
dollars to raise the dummy. He said it would take
him three days to rig his derrick, and bring down
his capstans from Ucayga. I was talking with him
when you hooked on and dragged the thing away.
You are a smart boy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“You shall not lose anything by the job, if you
do belong on the other side,” said the major, magnanimously.</p>

<p>“O, I don’t ask anything, sir. I only did it for
fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good fun, at any rate,” laughed the
great man. “The boys will think you are a little
god.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I shouldn’t have dared to meddle with
it if I had not fallen out with Colonel Wimpleton
and his son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, indeed?” queried the major, opening his
eyes, as a gleam of satisfaction passed over his face.
“We will talk that matter over when your job is
finished.”</p>

<p>By this time the students, who would have insulted
me if I had come among them at any other
time, had brought up the planks from the car, and
I proceeded to lay a track for the dummy wheels.
I placed two lines of wide ones as far as the iron
rails, sweeping them in curves, so as to turn the
engine as it neared the track. On them I laid narrower
planks for the wheels to run upon, gauging
them with a stick measured to the width of the
flanges of the wheels. When all was ready for a
start, I gave the signal with my handkerchief. The
steamer paddled and splashed, the rope strained, and
the dummy started again. I directed the students
to steady the planks so that they should not slip,
and in a couple of minutes, more or less, we had
the machine on the temporary track I had rigged. I
waved my handkerchief again, and the boat stopped.</p>

<p>“That will do, Tommy,” said I. “Tell your fellows
to cast off the snatch-block, and let the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
haul in his tow-line. We shall not want it any
more.”</p>

<p>“But the dummy is not on the track yet,” replied
Tommy, fearful that some delay might occur.</p>

<p>“We can move it on the planks easily enough
without the steamer; and she pulls so hard I am
afraid she will overdo the matter. Send a couple
of your fellows off in my skiff with the snatch-block
and ropes.”</p>

<p>The scion of the Toppleton house liked to be
“the biggest toad in the puddle,” and he gave off
his orders with great gusto to the students, not
always in as gentlemanly terms as I could have
wished, but with effect. He was promptly obeyed,
without dispute. I suggested to him that the cushions
and other movable articles in the passenger
compartment of the dummy should be removed, and
placed in the sun to dry. Tommy went at the
students as though the idea was his own, and made
all hands “stand around” for a moment. I was
very willing to flatter his vanity by letting him do
the ordering.</p>

<p>There was a brake in the engine-room, and another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
on the platform in the rear of the car. Tommy, at
my request, placed a student at each of them. I
then rigged a long rope at the forward end of the
dummy, which was manned by a crowd of boys,
while the men who were standing by took hold at
the sides and end of the car.</p>

<p>“Now start her, Tommy,” said I in a low tone,
so as to permit him to enjoy the pleasing illusion
that he was running the machine.</p>

<p>“Now, all together—ahead with her!” shouted
Tommy, flourishing his arms like the director of an
orchestra.</p>

<p>“Steady, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Steady!” yelled my mouthpiece.</p>

<p>The dummy moved slowly forward, till the drive-wheels
came to the iron track.</p>

<p>“Put on the brakes! Stop her!” shouted Tommy,
as I gave him the word.</p>

<p>The passage of the wheels from the planks down
to the iron track involved some difficulty; but, by
the aid of rocks and a couple of iron bars, the transit
was effected, and the dummy was safely deposited
on the rails in just an hour after the work began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>“Three cheers for the Lake Shore Railroad!”
shouted one of the students, in the violence of his
enthusiasm, when the job was completed.</p>

<p>They were given with a will.</p>

<p>“Three more for Wolf Penniman,” added another
student; and I was duly complimented, for which I
took off my cap and bowed my acknowledgments.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget Tommy,” I whispered to one of the
fellows.</p>

<p>“Three rousing cheers for Tommy Toppleton,”
called the student to whom I had given the hint.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of them thought that Mr. Tommy
had not done anything to entitle him to the consideration;
but the cheers were given, and supplemented
with a “tiger.”</p>

<p>“Fellow-students, I thank you for this compliment,
and for this evidence of your good will,” said
Tommy, taking off his hat. “I have done the best
I could to help along the Lake Shore Railroad, and
as the president of the company, I am much obliged
to you for this token of encouragement. When our
rolling stock was buried beneath the wave, it was
my duty to do something; and I’ve done it. I’m
glad you are satisfied with the result.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>

<p>Then Tommy was the president of the Lake Shore
Railroad Company! I did not know this before;
his zeal was fully explained, and I was all the more
pleased that I had permitted him to exercise the
lion’s share of the authority.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Major Toppleton,” squeaked a
little fellow, who thought the magnificent patron of
the enterprise had been neglected.</p>

<p>The great man bowed and smiled, as great men
always do when they are cheered; but he did not
take up any of our valuable time by making a speech.</p>

<p>“Tommy, we want some oil and some packing,” I
suggested to the president of the road, after I had
examined the machinery of the dummy.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can start her up to-night,
Wolf?” asked Tommy, anxiously, after he had
despatched half a dozen of his satellites for the
required articles.</p>

<p>“Certainly we can; you shall ride over to Spangleport,
and back to Middleport in her,” I replied.
“Now let some of your fellows bring up water to
fill the boiler and the tank, and we will get up
steam in the course of an hour or so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>The boys returned from the steam mill with packing
and oil; and, while others were bringing wood
and water, I rubbed up and oiled the machinery.
Brooms, mops, and cloths were obtained, and, under
Tommy’s direction, the passenger portion of the car
was cleaned and wiped. The engine had been well
oiled before it was sent up from Philadelphia, and I
had nothing to do but wipe off the water and lubricate
the running parts. I kindled a fire in the furnace,
and, when the smoke began to pour out of the
smoke-stack, the students yelled for joy.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>THE FIRST TRIP OF THE DUMMY.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I was in my element—in charge of a steam-engine.
Though I had never seen a dummy
before this one, I comprehended the machinery at
a glance. I hardly heard the tumultuous yells of
the Toppletonians as they manifested their joy, so
absorbed was I in the study of the machine, and in
the anticipation of what wonderful things it would
do. Such an excited crowd as that which surrounded
me I had never seen, and I was obliged
to close the door of the engine-room to keep them
out. I opened it with due deference when Mr.
Tommy Toppleton, the president of the Lake Shore
Railroad, made a demand for admission, but I remorselessly
excluded the board of directors and
the superintendent, to their great mortification, no
doubt; but I did not know them just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>Tommy and his father were busily engaged in a
conversation which seemed to relate to me, when
I rang the bell to indicate that the engine was
ready for a start. This announcement was greeted
with the usual volley of cheers, and the young gentlemen
began to pile into the passenger apartment
to a degree which perilled the powers of the car.
There were at least a hundred of them, and it was
impossible to accommodate the whole. The major
directed his son to divide them into two companies;
and, though all of them manifested a childish impatience
to have the first ride, they submitted to
the arrangement. Fifty of them filled the car, and
Major Toppleton and Tommy honored me with their
company in the engine-room.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” shouted the president.</p>

<p>“I think they need no such invitation,” I added,
laughing.</p>

<p>“We must do things up in shape, you know. We
are all ready now, Wolf,” replied Tommy, highly
excited.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about the road on which
I am to run, Mr. President,” I suggested, as a preparation
for any accident which might happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>“The road is all right, you may depend upon
that,” answered Tommy.</p>

<p>“Of course, if the rails happen to be spread, or
anything of that sort, we shall be thrown off the
track.”</p>

<p>“I sent a man over it with a gauge, yesterday,
and he reported it to be in perfect condition,” interposed
the major. “It would be very unfortunate
to have any accident happen, and I have taken
every precaution to guard against one.”</p>

<p>“I think we had better run very slowly the first
time,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You can’t be too careful, young man.”</p>

<p>“Let her drive, Wolf!” said Tommy, impatiently.</p>

<p>I let off the brake, and opened the valve. The
steam hissed in the most natural and encouraging
manner, and the dummy began to move, amid the
shouts of those on board and those on the ground.
The road was very level and straight, and the car
moved as easily as a boat in the water, though the
engine made a disagreeable puffing and twanging
noise in its action.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span></p>

<p>“Here we go!” roared Tommy, at the top of his
lungs, swinging his cap to the boys who stood at
the sides, looking in at the door. “This is bully!”</p>

<p>“Exceedingly bully!” laughed his father.</p>

<p>“I should like to run through some of the Wimpleton
fellows about this time,” added the president.
“They would find out that our side of the lake is
wide awake.”</p>

<p>I did not care to present myself to the Wimpletonians
just at that moment. If I had, I should
have been mobbed as a traitor to my own side;
though, after the treatment which Centreport, in the
persons of its magnate and its magnate’s son, had
bestowed upon me, my conscience did not reproach
me for infidelity. I had actually been driven out of
the place, and the colonel had no right to expect
anything different from me.</p>

<p>The dummy went along very smoothly, and worked
so well that I ventured to “let her out” a little
more. The outsiders, in their excitement, had followed
us so far; but, as I let on the steam, we
ran away from them, the outsiders giving a rousing
cheer as we distanced them. The ground on which
the road was laid was nearly a dead level, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
in some places a shelf on the side hill on the
border of the lake had been dug out. Between
Spangleport and the other terminus, two bridges had
been built over a couple of brooks, and the expense
of constructing the road was little more than the
cost of sleepers and rails.</p>

<p>In about half an hour we reached Spangleport,
which consisted of a wharf, a store, and about a
dozen houses, on the lake shore, though there was
quite a large village a mile distant. The occupants
of the dozen houses turned out in a body, as the
dummy went hissing and sizzling on its way. The
students yelled and cheered, and the Spangleporters
manifested their enthusiasm in a proper manner. It
was a great occasion for Spangleport, and both
natives and visitors made the most of it during the
few moments we remained.</p>

<p>As there was no turn-table, we were obliged to
run to Middleport backwards; but one of the conductors
was placed on the forward platform to keep
a lookout, and as he could ring a bell in the engine-room
by pulling the strap, the car could be stopped
in an instant. But there were no road crossings or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
obstructions of any kind to bother us, and we went
ahead at a high rate of speed, rushing through the
crowd of students we had left where the dummy
was raised, and stopping only when we reached
Middleport.</p>

<p>The whole village turned out to greet the dummy
when she appeared; but we left our freight, and immediately
returned to take up the waiting party,
who were impatiently anticipating their first ride on
the machine. I was beginning to grow tired of
yelling and cheering; for I was not disposed to be
very demonstrative myself, and I hoped the novelty
would soon wear off, so that we could move without
seeming like a horde of wild Indians. Probably
I did not enjoy the stirring events of the day
as much as I should if I had no trouble on the
other side of the lake; for, in spite of the excitement
of running the dummy, I could not help thinking,
occasionally, of my poor mother, who was wondering
what had become of me. I dreaded to hear from
my father, for I was afraid that he had renewed
his drinking after I left the boat. It seemed to
me just as though our happy family had been broken in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
pieces by the events of that day; and I could not
shake off a certain degree of sadness that hung over
me.</p>

<p>I stopped the engine when we came to the party
of students who were waiting for us, and they piled
in like a flock of sheep. Tommy shouted, “All
aboard!” after he was positively sure that every
fellow was in the car; and we went off again in
the midst of a din of cheers and yells that would
have beggared Bedlam.</p>

<p>“Let her slide now—can’t you, Wolf?” said
Tommy. “Make her spin!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to run her too fast, till she gets a
little used to it,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of her?”</p>

<p>“No; but it’s all a new thing, and we must be
careful, as your father said.”</p>

<p>“Father isn’t here, now,” answered Tommy; for
the young gentleman had insisted that the machine
should be run by the boys alone on this trip.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to smash you up, Mr. President;
but I will obey orders.”</p>

<p>“All right; let her slide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span></p>

<p>I let her go as fast as I thought it was safe
for her to go; but I did not regard Tommy as a
very safe president. By this time I felt quite at
home on the engine; but I should have enjoyed it
more if I had been alone, for I did not like the
interference of my companion. I foresaw that, under
his direction, many risks must be run, and that it
would be difficult always to keep on the right side
of him. He was good-natured now, but I knew
very well that such was not his invariable habit.
Like Waddie Wimpleton, he was disposed to be
tyrannical and overbearing. He liked his own way
and it was not very pleasant to think of being his
dependent.</p>

<p>We ran up to Spangleport; and, after a vast
amount of cheering and yelling by the boys, and
a reasonable display of enthusiasm on the part of
the inhabitants, we started for the return. Tommy
wanted to go faster; and I was very much afraid
I should have a quarrel with him before night. Running
backwards, I could not see anything ahead of
the dummy, and I had not entire confidence in the
lookout on the forward platform. Fortunately we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
had not a large supply of fuel on board, and this
afforded me a sufficient excuse for not getting up
too much steam.</p>

<p>We ran into Middleport, where the rest of the
students, and hundreds of men, women, and children
were waiting to see more of the dummy. By
this time it was well dried off, and all the varnished
parts had been rubbed by the boys till it
looked as good as new. A house had already been
built for the engine, near the Institute. It was provided
with a water cistern, from which the tanks
in the engine could be filled, and with other conveniences
for taking care of it.</p>

<p>When the people had examined the car to their
satisfaction, I ran it into the engine-house, put out
the fire, and placed the machinery in proper order
for use the next day. My work for that occasion
was done, and I felt that I had “put her through
by daylight.”</p>

<p>“Now, Wolf, father wants to see you at the
house,” said Tommy, when I had finished my task
on the engine.</p>

<p>“What does he want of me?” I asked, curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, he wants to see you,” answered the young
gentleman; and he deemed this a sufficient reason
why I should do as I was asked.</p>

<p>I followed Tommy to the great mansion, and was
ushered into the library, where the major was reading
the newspapers which had just come by the
mail.</p>

<p>“Well, Wolf, I’m glad to see you,” said the magnate
of Middleport, laying aside his paper. “You
have done more than a man’s work to-day, and I
want to pay you for it. Will a hundred dollars
satisfy you for your afternoon’s job?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and more too; I don’t ask anything
for what I have done,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too modest, my boy,” added the major,
placing a roll of bank bills in my hand.</p>

<p>“I am very much obliged to you, sir. I didn’t
ask or expect anything. I only came over here
because I had to leave Centreport, and I did the
work for the fun of it.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless it was good fun; but you have done
us a good turn, and I have not overpaid you. Now
tell me about your difficulty with Wimpleton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>I told him the story about the events of the day.
I think it quite likely the major thought he was
encouraging a rebel; but he did not express any
dissatisfaction with my conduct. On the contrary
he praised my spirit, and declared that Middleport
would be glad to take me up, if Centreport wished
to cast me out. He then offered me a dollar a day
to run the dummy; but I told him I could not accept
it till I had consulted my father and mother,
and it was arranged that I should see him the
next day.</p>

<p>I then went to the shore, took my skiff, and rowed
across the lake, feeling like a rich man.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>MOTHER’S ADVICE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>For the first time in my life I had some fears
in regard to meeting my father. I dreaded
the terrible infirmity which was beginning to develop
itself anew in him. Under ordinary circumstances I
should have been glad to see him; and with a hundred
dollars in my pocket—the first money I had
ever earned by my knowledge and skill—I should
have been delighted to tell him the history of the
day. I should have been sure of a proud and sympathetic
listener in him as I detailed the means I
had used to raise the dummy.</p>

<p>I feared two things—first, that he would be intoxicated;
and second, that he would remember
against me the deed I had done with the strange-looking
bottle in the forenoon. In relation to the
latter, I had come to see that the destruction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
whiskey was not the only or the greater cause of
offence. By emptying the bottle, I had censured
him, virtually, and made myself a judge of his condition
and conduct. My father was a plucky man,
in spite of his position as an employee of Colonel
Wimpleton, and, right or wrong, would not suffer
any one to be a censor upon his actions.</p>

<p>I feared that his anger would not go down with
the sun; and I had an utter horror of any quarrel
in the family. Besides, I had a great admiration of
my father. I considered him one of the best and
one of the most skilful men of his craft on the lake.
I could not endure the thought of any coldness on
his part or the feeling that I had suffered in his
estimation. I knew he had been proud of me as a
scholar, and especially proud of the reputation I had
earned as a young engineer. My readers, therefore,
will not be surprised when I say that my bosom
bounded with emotion as I thought of meeting him
after the occurrences of the day. If he was only
sober, and in his right mind, all would be well
with me.</p>

<p>I had heard in Middleport that the Ruoara, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
her down trip, had obtained an engineer at Hitaca;
therefore I supposed my father had gone home.
The storekeeper on the wharf had seen him; but I
did not dare to ask whether he was intoxicated.
Never before, I repeat, had I gone to my father’s
house with any doubts or misgivings. It was quite
dark when I reached the mill wharf, and secured my
skiff at its moorings. When I started from Middleport
with a hundred dollars in my pocket, I felt like
a rich man. During my silent pull across the lake I
thought of our family trouble, and when I landed at
Centreport I felt as though I had lost a hundred
dollars, and that I was even poorer than usual.</p>

<p>With stealthy step I crept through the garden,
fearful that I might encounter my father intoxicated.
There was a light in the kitchen, and I stood on
tiptoe, so that I could look in at the window. My
father was not there. The supper table was waiting
in the middle of the room, and my good mother sat
at one corner of it, sewing, while my two sisters
were reading near her. I opened the back door
and went in, but not without the fear that I should
be told my father was helpless in his bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Wolfert, where have you been?” asked
my mother, rising as I entered. “I needn’t ask you,
for I have heard all about it.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“You have been over to Middleport, at work for
the Toppleton boys.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I do it, mother?” I inquired,
not a little astonished to find that she was inflamed
by the rivalry between the two houses.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you do it! Because it will make
trouble, Wolfert. When the boat brought over the
news that you had raised the dummy, or whatever
they call the thing, and that you were running it on
the railroad over there, the people howled just as
though you had set the town on fire. The Wimpleton
boys say they will mob you, tar and feather
you, and I don’t know what not,” said my poor
mother, who appeared to be really suffering under
this manifestation of popular indignation.</p>

<p>“It seems just as though I am bound to put my
foot in it, whether I will or not. Do folks tell the
rest of the story?” I inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span></p>

<p>“The rest of what story?” asked my mother,
opening her eyes.</p>

<p>“Do they say that I was hunted out of town like
a wild beast?” I demanded, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Why, no; they didn’t say anything of that kind.
The girls came home just before dark, and said
everybody was talking about you; that you had
turned traitor.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have, mother; but I don’t care a fig
for this three-cent quarrel between the two sides of
the lake. I hope you won’t turn against me, mother,”
I added, choking up with emotion, so that I
could not speak.</p>

<p>“Turn against you! Why, no, Wolfert, I shall
never turn against you. Who ever heard of such a
thing?”</p>

<p>“You seem to blame me for what I have done,” I
replied, wiping away a truant tear, and struggling
hard for utterance.</p>

<p>“I only said what you have done will make
trouble. You know Colonel Wimpleton will not
like it; and he will punish us all for your acts.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, mother. I was driven away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by being driven away?”</p>

<p>It occurred to me that my mother knew nothing
of what had happened since Waddie had called to
deliver the fictitious message from his father; and I
told her the whole story.</p>

<p>“If I know my father, he would kick me if I
should get down on my knees to Waddie Wimpleton.
Be that as it may, I won’t do it,” I added.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to do it. If it has come to
that, I think we had all better go to the poorhouse
at once,” said my mother, with more spirit than I
remembered to have seen her exhibit before; and I
felt then that she was on my side.</p>

<p>“We won’t go to the poorhouse,” I replied, taking
the hundred dollars from my wallet. “I made that
to-day.”</p>

<p>My mother opened her eyes again, as she was in
the habit of doing when astonished. Then she
counted the money, and for an instant a smile overspread
her pleasant face. To me it was the pleasantest
face in all the world, and I had never before
seen it saddened for so long a time as it had been
that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p>“A hundred dollars!” exclaimed she, looking
at me.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother; that is what Major Toppleton gave
me for getting the dummy out of the water, and
putting it on the track. It was a good job.”</p>

<p>“The major is liberal; and I only wish he and
the colonel would be friends again.”</p>

<p>“I wish they would; but whether they are or not,
I’m not going to fight the battle of either one of
them. Now, mother, I want to make a clean breast
of it. What you said to me after the colonel went
away wasn’t lost upon me. I was sorry I called
Waddie a liar to his face, though all the world
knows that he is one; and I was really sorry that
I had said anything saucy to the colonel. When
Waddie said he was going to lick me, I apologized
to him; and I did to the colonel when I saw him.
I think I did it handsomely, considering that they
were going to lick me.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did, Wolfert.”</p>

<p>“It was like pulling out half a dozen of my teeth
to do it, but I did it; and I was sincere in doing
it, too. I won’t go down on my knees to any one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and I won’t confess a crime of which I’m not
guilty;” and in my zeal I struck the table a blow
with my fist which made all the dishes dance
upon it.</p>

<p>“Do right, Wolfert, and pray to God for strength.
He will help you, and all will be well in the end.
Have you seen anything of your father?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him; but he came over on the
Ruoara from the other side. I supposed he was at
home,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen anything of him since he went
out this morning,” she added, looking very anxious.</p>

<p>I ate my supper, still discussing the exciting topic
of the day. I felt better; for, if my mother was on
my side, I could afford to have almost everybody else
against me; and she was a Christian woman, who
would rather have buried me than had me do any
great wrong. Whatever my readers, old and young,
may think of me, I feel bound to say that I had tried
to do right. I had been goaded into the use of impudent
speech by the intolerable tyranny of the
magnate of Centreport; but I had apologized for it,
and had been willing to make any reasonable reparation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
My mother had taught me, as a child, to
go down on my knees before God, but never to
man.</p>

<p>I kissed my sisters, who were younger than I, and
they went to bed about eight o’clock. My mother
and I could now talk about the condition of my
father, which neither of us was willing to do before
them. We wondered what had become of him; but
I was pretty sure that he was somewhere in Centreport.
It was a new experience in our family to
be waiting at night for him, for he always spent his
evenings at home.</p>

<p>I told my mother of the offer which Major Toppleton
had made me to run the dummy. For a
boy of my age, and at a distance from the great
city, the proposition was a liberal one, for my father
only had sixty dollars a month. It is true I was to
do a man’s work for half wages; but no boy in that
region could make half the money offered to me at
that time.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can take up with the offer,”
said my mother. “Colonel Wimpleton would not
have anything to do with us if we did anything to
help along the people on the other side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can accept it, but it is a
great pity I cannot,” I replied, moodily; for I should
have been glad to run the dummy for nothing if the
major was not willing to pay me.</p>

<p>“It is a pity; but only think how mad the colonel
would be if you should go!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he could be any madder than
he is now. I am sick and disgusted with this stupid
quarrel!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he would discharge your father if he
should let you go over to Middleport to work for
the major. Those two men hate each other like
evil spirits,” replied my mother.</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t want father to lose his situation;
and if it comes to that, I suppose I must
decline the offer.”</p>

<p>“I think you must, Wolfert.”</p>

<p>“I will, mother,” I added, sorely aggrieved at the
alternative. “I will not do anything to make a
quarrel, though I think it is about time I should be
earning something.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there will be a chance for you on this
side; for I am sure the colonel will do something
to get even with the major on that railroad. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
will get up another railroad, a balloon, a flying
machine, or something or other.”</p>

<p>“He can’t build any railroad on this side,” I replied.
“The country is so rough that it would cost
him all he is worth. But if he did, he wouldn’t
give me anything to do upon it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he”—</p>

<p>My mother’s remark was interrupted by a noise in
the garden; and, fearful that my poor father had
come home in a helpless condition, I went out to
ascertain the cause of it. It was not my father; but
I heard sounds which indicated that several persons
were running away from the house. I ran to the
fence, and saw three boys hastening up the road
towards the Institute. If I was not much mistaken,
Waddie Wimpleton was one of them; and I concluded
that he was still intent upon punishing me
for calling him a liar.</p>

<p>As I was about to go into the house, I discovered
another form in the darkness, walking down the road.
I knew the step. It was my father. I was very
thankful that he was able to walk, though I noticed
that his step was a little unsteady.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>WADDIE’S MISTAKE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I hastened into the house, and told my
mother that father was coming. She bestowed
upon me a glance so full of anxiety that I comprehended
the question she desired to ask, and I
added that he walked tolerably well.</p>

<p>“Was it he that made the noise we heard?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>“No; some of the students have been around
here, and I think I saw Waddie,” I replied.</p>

<p>“What do they want?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but I suppose they wish to see
me.”</p>

<p>“Do be careful, Wolfert.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of them, mother. I think I can
take care of myself in the face of the whole crowd.”</p>

<p>My father came in at the back door, interrupting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the conversation. His step was unsteady and his
movements uncertain. He stayed a long time in the
entry putting away his hat, but at last he entered
the kitchen. He made desperate struggles to conceal
his condition; but he failed to do so. I could
see my poor mother’s bosom bounding with emotion
as the days of evil came back to her from the
past. There was a tear in her eye; but she spoke
not a word of reproach. My father walked across
the room to his accustomed chair, and dropped
heavily into it.</p>

<p>“Wolf!” said he in a tone which was intended
to be sharp, but which was very thick from the
effects of the liquor.</p>

<p>“I am here, father,” I replied, as little able to
control my feelings as my mother.</p>

<p>“You have been a bad boy!” he added, fiercely.
“You have disgraced your father!”</p>

<p>I thought not, but I did not deem it advisable
to say so, or to utter a word that would irritate
him.</p>

<p>“I used to think you were a smart boy; but
now I think you are a fool,” he continued, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
oath, which I had never before heard him use.
“With a pistol in your hand you let Christy carry
off all my money. I wouldn’t say anything about
that, but you came home, insulted and abused Colonel
Wimp’ton and his son. You hadn’t done your
worst yet; so you went over to Middleport, and
turned traitor to the friends that feed and clothe
you. I know all about it!”</p>

<p>It was no use to talk about these things while he
was in his present condition, and I held my peace.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen Colonel Wimp’ton, and he ztold me
all about it,” my father went on, rapping the table
violently with his fist. “I won’t have my boy
behave zo. I’ll lick him first.”</p>

<p>“Why, father, Wolfert has not done anything
bad,” interposed my mother.</p>

<p>“I zsay he has!” replied my father furiously.
“He’n Waddie blowed up the canal boat. Then
Wolf denied it, and insulted his best friends. Then
he went off and run that dummy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything, mother,” said I to her, in
a low tone.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded my father, suspiciously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
“What did you say, Wolf? Do you mean to
insult me, as you did Colonel Wimp’ton?”</p>

<p>But I will not follow this unpleasant scene any
further in detail. It was evident that my father
had seen the magnate of Centreport, and that the
great man had won him over. He was stormy,
violent, and suspicious. He was angry with me,
and then with my mother for speaking a word in
my defence. Finally he wept like a child, declaring
that his family had turned against him; and,
overwhelmed by this maudlin grief, he went upstairs
and threw himself upon my bed. I think he intended
to occupy the spare chamber on the other
side of the entry, for he was so angry with my
mother and me that he was intent upon getting
away from us.</p>

<p>We decided that it would be best to let him
alone. He lay sobbing on the bed for a time, and
then dropped asleep. My mother went in, and,
having assured herself that he was in a comfortable
position, took away the lamp. She and I sat up
till midnight, talking over the bitter prospect before
us. In his cups my father was another man. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
mother told me with tears in her eyes, that he had
abused her when he used to drink before. In his
intoxication he seemed to hate the family he loved
so well when he was sober.</p>

<p>At midnight he was still sleeping off the effects
of his debauch, and we retired, hoping for better
things in the morning. I was so tired that I went
to sleep very soon. I occupied the spare chamber
on the second floor, while my mother’s room was
downstairs. I do not know how long I had slept,
but I was awakened by a violent noise in the opposite
side of the house, which seemed to come from
the apartment where my father was. I was startled,
and immediately leaped out of bed, lighted a
lamp, and hastily put on my clothes. Hearing my
father’s voice in excited tones, I rushed to the room
with the lamp in my hand. I feared that the liquor
he <ins id='c198' title='original: had drank'>had drunk</ins> had in some manner affected his
brain, and induced a delirium.</p>

<p>I opened the door. I saw my father standing
over the prostrate form of Waddie Wimpleton. The
window was wide open, and I heard voices outside,
as of other boys effecting a hasty retreat. Waddie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
lay still upon the floor, and his face was covered
with blood.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, father?” I asked, terrified
at the strange sight which I beheld.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see what the matter is?” replied my
father; but he seemed to be very much confused.</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” answered he, gazing at the form
of Waddie.</p>

<p>My father had slept several hours, and he appeared
to be quite sober.</p>

<p>“This is Waddie Wimpleton,” said I, bending over
the fallen youth.</p>

<p>“I see it is. I felt a hand upon me, and I started
up from the bed. Some one caught hold of me,
and I struck right and left, till I heard some one
fall,” answered my father, rubbing his eyes, as if to
stimulate his bewildered senses. “I thought it was
some one who had come to rob me, and I couldn’t
help believing it was Christy Holgate.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter?” cried my
mother, who now came into the room, pale and
trembling with terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>

<p>I explained, as far as I could, the circumstances
of the affair. My father said nothing, but went to
the window and looked out.</p>

<p>“There is a ladder under the window,” said he.</p>

<p>“But Waddie is not a robber,” added my mother,
kneeling on the floor at his side. “His face is cut,
and he seems to be stunned.”</p>

<p>My father and I lifted him up, and placed him
on the bed. My mother went to work upon him,
sending me down to assure my sisters that no harm
could come to them. I brought up some water
and the camphor bottle. On my return my father
seemed to be quite like himself, and was assisting
in the restoration of the injured boy.</p>

<p>“He isn’t badly hurt, I think,” said my mother.
“One of his front teeth is knocked in, and the blood
on his face comes from a mere scratch. What in
the world was he doing here?”</p>

<p>“I understand it now,” I replied. “Waddie and
the other fellows were after me. I saw them around
the house about eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“What do they want of you?” asked my father,
whose head had been filled with the other side of
the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>

<p>“They were going to punish me, I suppose, for
what I said to Waddie and his father, though I
apologized to both of them for it.”</p>

<p>“What is to be done with this boy?” interposed
my mother, anxiously, as Waddie opened his eyes,
and looked wildly around the room. “I think the
doctor had better see him.”</p>

<p>I went for the doctor, and came back with him,
for he had just returned from a night visit to a
distant patient, and his horse was harnessed at the
door. When we arrived, Waddie was sitting up
in the kitchen. The physician examined his head,
and declared that he had sustained no injury that he
could perceive. My father, who had been alarmed
for the consequences of the blow he had struck,
breathed easier after this announcement.</p>

<p>“I’m going home,” said Waddie, rising from the
chair, after the doctor had finished his examination.
“I’ll bet you haven’t theen the latht of thith thcrape.
I thall”—</p>

<p>The scion put his hand up to his mouth, and wondered
why he could not speak without lisping. He
had fully recovered his senses, under the vigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
treatment of my mother, and with them came back
the evil spirit which controlled him.</p>

<p>“What were you doing in my house, Waddie?”
asked my father.</p>

<p>“What wath I doing? I wath going to give
Wolf fitth for being a traitor and calling me a liar.
And I’ll do it yet, if it coths me my life!” replied
Waddie, vigorously, as he held one hand on his
mouth.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you’d break into a man’s house in
the night,” added my father.</p>

<p>“Wolf ith going to work on the other thide, and
that’th the only time we could catch him. What
did you hit me for?” demanded the scion, rubbing
his sore head with his hand.</p>

<p>“I did not know it was you, Waddie,” answered
my father, meekly. “You came into my room in
the dark, when I was asleep.”</p>

<p>“It wathn’t your room. It wath Wolf’th room.
What were you doing in there?”</p>

<p>“It’s my own house, and I have a right to occupy
any room I please,” said my father, with more spirit
than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<p>“You were boothy latht night and didn’t know
what you were about.”</p>

<p>My father’s brow contracted, and his lips were
compressed. To be told that he was intoxicated
galled him sorely. Waddie declared that he had
struck him on purpose, and that he should suffer
for it. The doctor then took him into his chaise,
and conveyed him to his home. My father was
not satisfied with the situation. He went to the
pump, and drank a large mug of water. He walked
up and down the kitchen in silence for a moment,
and then said he must see Colonel Wimpleton at
once. He went, and by going through the grove
he could reach the house as soon as the doctor.</p>

<p>I did not see him again that night, and he did
not come out of his room till eight o’clock the
next morning. I was very anxious to know how he
would regard me, after the hard words he had
spoken the night before. I was also curious to learn
what had passed at Colonel Wimpleton’s during
his visit. Our relations with the magnate were certainly
very singular and perplexing. As nearly as
I could judge, my father stood exactly in my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
position in regard to him. Neither of us had intended
to insult or injure the great man or his son,
but both had incurred his displeasure; for it would
be impossible for the colonel to forgive the unwitting
blow my father had struck.</p>

<p>“Wolf,” said my father, after he had eaten his
breakfast, “your mother tells me you have an offer
on the other side.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You may accept it, and go to work to-day, if
you wish.”</p>

<p>“I should be very glad to do so,” I replied. “Did
you have any trouble with Colonel Wimpleton?”</p>

<p>“I did. He discharged me, and ordered me out
of his house,” he answered, gloomily.</p>

<p>Of one thing I was sure—my father was not
angry with me.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>RICH MEN’S QUARRELS.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>My father was himself again. He was clothed
in his right mind once more. He even appeared
to have forgotten that I had emptied the
bottle the day before, and treated me as kindly as
though nothing had occurred to mar the unity
which had always subsisted between us. My mother
seemed to be quite happy, too; and, while I was
at work in the garden, she told me she had talked
till daylight with him, after his return from Colonel
Wimpleton’s. He had bitterly bewailed his error,
and solemnly promised not to taste another drop
of liquor. He was conscious that he had lost his
twenty-four hundred dollars by getting intoxicated,
and he had very little hope of ever seeing it again.</p>

<p>More than this, my mother had explained my
conduct to him, and he was satisfied with it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
night visit of Waddie, and the colonel’s unreasonable
harshness to him, had probably done more to
convince him than any words of my mother. He
had lost his situation, and had been treated with
gross injustice, for the great man would not accept
his explanation of the blow he had given his son.</p>

<p>“Wolf,” said my father, after he had granted me
permission to accept Major Toppleton’s offer, “I am
afraid we shall soon be in trouble all round.”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“If I had the money to pay off the mortgage
on the house, I should not care so much. As it
is, I may lose even the thousand dollars I have paid
on it. The colonel will foreclose on me at once,
and people here will not dare to bid when it is put
up at auction, if he tells them not to do so.”</p>

<p>“I heard you say you had an offer of thirty-five
hundred dollars for the place.”</p>

<p>“So I had; Bingham offered that for it.”</p>

<p>“I would go to him, and take the offer at once.”</p>

<p>“What, sell the place?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you can pay off the mortgage, and then
have fifteen hundred left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” replied my father. “But I
don’t know that Bingham will give thirty-five hundred
now.”</p>

<p>“I would try him, at any rate. I think we had
better move out of Centreport.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be as well, after what has happened,”
said he, in deep thought. “I will see what
can be done.”</p>

<p>My father hastened to the village to see Bingham,
and soon after I pulled across the lake to report
for duty to Major Toppleton. I was shown
into his elegant library; but I found the magnate
of Middleport in violent wrath.</p>

<p>“I have called, sir, to say that I will accept the
offer you were so kind as to make to me yesterday,”
I began, with the utmost deference.</p>

<p>“Very well, boy, I am a man of honor, which
cannot be said of every man who lives on the other
side of the lake,”—by which, of course, he meant
Colonel Wimpleton,—“and I will keep my agreement;
but if the business were to be done over
again, I wouldn’t have anything to do with a person
from Centreport.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry you think so hard of us, sir,” I ventured
to reply. “I will do the very best I can for
you; and I hope we shall not live in Centreport
much longer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I need to blame you
for what Wimpleton does. He is a mean man, and
his soul is smaller than a mosquito’s. This morning
the old rascal sent his agent over here to offer
the engineer of my flour mills twenty dollars a
month more than he is getting now. The villain
was paid up to last night, and left without giving
me any notice, and my mills are all stopped.”</p>

<p>Major Toppleton walked the library in a violent
rage, and I waited for further developments before
I dared to speak.</p>

<p>“He hired my engineer away from me, I’m told,
because I employed you,” added the magnate, pausing
before me.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry I made any trouble,” I answered,
diffidently.</p>

<p>“You didn’t make it. I only wonder how Wimpleton
was my friend for so many years. He omits
no opportunity to stab me when he gets a chance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
I suppose he is gloating over it now because no
smoke rises from my mills.”</p>

<p>“Do you want an engineer, sir?” I had the audacity
to ask at this opportune moment.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. Wimpleton sent over for mine
solely to vex me, and I would give a thousand dollars
to be even with him this moment.”</p>

<p>“I can run the engine of your mills,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I have run the Centreport mills for a
week at a time.”</p>

<p>“But I want you on the dummy.”</p>

<p>“I will bring you an engineer, then, in an hour.
What wages will you give, sir?”</p>

<p>“I will give the same that Wimpleton pays the
man he stole from me—eighty dollars a month,
and engage him for a year.”</p>

<p>“I will have him here in one hour, sir.”</p>

<p>“But who is he?”</p>

<p>“My father, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!”</p>

<p>“Colonel Wimpleton discharged him before daylight
this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>“Then I am to take a man whom Wimpleton has
discharged, and pay him twenty dollars more than
he was having before.”</p>

<p>“He discharged my father in order to punish him,”
I replied; and then I told him the sequel to the
story I had related the day before.</p>

<p>“Very good! Excellent! I will help Wimpleton
punish your father by giving him eighty dollars a
month, which is twenty dollars more than any engineer
ought to have. Go for him at once.”</p>

<p>I never pulled across the lake so quickly before
as I did then. I found my father at home; he had
just returned from his visit to Bingham.</p>

<p>“Back so soon, Wolf?” said he; and he looked
quite sad.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Did you see Bingham?”</p>

<p>“I did; but it’s too late. He has heard of the
quarrel, and won’t buy the house at any price. It
will go hard with me, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, father. It will come out right in
the end, I know.”</p>

<p>“What did you come back for?”</p>

<p>“Major Toppleton wants you, and will engage you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
for a year, at eighty dollars a month,” I replied,
with proper enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Eighty dollars!”</p>

<p>I explained what Colonel Wimpleton had done,
and what Major Toppleton wished to do.</p>

<p>“He wants you right off, this minute,” I added.</p>

<p>“I’m all ready.”</p>

<p>“When rich men quarrel, poor men ought to profit
by it, if they can do so honestly,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“The colonel will be the maddest man this side
of the north pole, when he hears of my good fortune,”
said my father.</p>

<p>“I dare say he will, for it appears that he has
only discharged you to open the way to a much
better position.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so!” exclaimed my father, delighted with
the situation. “If rich men will be fools, we cannot
help it, as you say, Wolf.”</p>

<p>My father took the bundle of old clothes he had
just brought from the mill; and we went down to
the wharf, where we embarked in the skiff for the
other side of the lake.</p>

<p>“If you could only sell the place, father, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
might move over to Middleport at once,” said I,
pulling with all my might at the oars.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can do it. By this time everybody
knows that the colonel has quarrelled with
me, and no one will run the risk of offending him
by buying it,” replied my father. “I hope Mortimer
will catch Christy, and get back part of my
money, if not the whole of it.”</p>

<p>We landed in Middleport, and hastened to the
mansion of the major. He was ever so much better
humored than when I had called upon him before.
He had evidently considered the nature of the victory
he had won over his powerful rival, for he had
certainly cheated the colonel out of his revenge
upon my father, and practically nullified his punishment.
He appeared to be duly comforted.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Penniman,” said he,
graciously, as my father bowed low to him.</p>

<p>“I am very grateful to you for your kind offer,
sir, and I accept it thankfully,” replied my father.</p>

<p>“I wish to see the smoke rising from the chimney
of the mill at once,” added the major, briskly. “I
want Wimpleton to understand that he can’t shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
me up. Go to the mill, and get up steam as fast as
you can; and the more smoke you make, the better,
for that will be my sign of triumph.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fire up at once,” replied my father, leaving
the room, and hastening to his work.</p>

<p>Young and inexperienced as I was, I could not
help feeling sad at this exhibition of malignity on
the part of the rich man of Middleport. The colonel
had taken the opportunity afforded by the dismissal
of my father to strike his rival in a tender place.
It was mean; but such was the character of the
dealings between them, when they had any. The
major rubbed his hands with delight, and paced the
library under the exhilaration of the moment. It
was a pity that these men, with such vast means
of doing good within their grasp, should quarrel
with each other, and debase and demoralize a whole
neighborhood by their actions.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Penniman, I suppose you are ready to
go to work,” said the major, pausing before me after
a time.</p>

<p>Mr. Penniman! I felt an inch taller to have a
handle applied to my name by such a magnificent
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I am waiting for orders.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think that dummy isn’t much of
an engine,” he added, with a very pleasant smile
upon his face.</p>

<p>“I think it works very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you do; but I want to say, a thing
like that is not the height of our ambition,” he continued,
rubbing his hands under the influence of
some undeveloped idea.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I shouldn’t wish for anything better
than the dummy.”</p>

<p>“It answers very well to begin with; but I have
a regular locomotive and two cars in process of
building, and I shall have them on the track this
fall.”</p>

<p>“Is it a big locomotive?” I asked, curiously.</p>

<p>“No, it’s a small one; and it will be the prettiest
plaything you ever saw. I’m determined that the
Toppleton Institute shall be the most popular one
in the country.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Colonel Wimpleton will do something
to offset this movement on your part,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“What can he do?” asked the major, anxiously.
“Have you heard of anything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir. I only know they feel very bad about
the Lake Shore Railroad over there.”</p>

<p>“They will feel worse before we get through with
it,” replied the magnate, shaking his head. “What
can they do? They can’t build a railroad, the country
is so rough. We can keep ahead of them now.
But I want that dummy in motion. You must run
it every half hour for the rest of the day between
Middleport and Spangleport. Carry everybody who
wishes to ride. I want the Centreport people to
see it, and to know that we are alive on this side.”</p>

<p>“Will the students be with me?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“This afternoon, when they are dismissed from the
school-room, they will be. I will send you a conductor.
Let me see; Higgins is too sick to study,
and just sick enough to play. He shall run with you.
Now keep her going, as though you meant business.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir; I will put her through by daylight,”
I replied, as I left the library.</p>

<p class='chap-title'>THE BEAUTIFUL PASSENGER.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I found the dummy just as I had left it on
the preceding day. I kindled a fire in the
furnace, rubbed down the machinery, filled up the
water tank, and took on a supply of coal, which
was the kind of fuel intended to be used under the
boiler. I assure my sympathetic reader that I felt
a real pleasure in the discharge of these duties, and
in the consciousness that I was actually the master
of the machine. Though my taste was rather inclined
towards the engine of a steamer, I was more
than satisfied with my present position, and deemed
myself the luckiest dog in the world.</p>

<p>Higgins, the invalid student, who was to officiate
as conductor, stood by and watched all my movements
with the most intense interest. He looked
like a clever fellow, and I proceeded to make friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
with him in due form, by declaring that I was sorry
he was sick.</p>

<p>“I’m not sorry,” said he with a grin. “I’m
rather glad I’m sick. In fact, I’m not very sick.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you were; the major said so;
at least he said you were too sick to study, and
just sick enough to play.”</p>

<p>“Did he say that?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Well, he knows a thing or two,” laughed Higgins.
“My mother thinks it makes my head ache to
study; and in fact it does when the lessons are hard.”</p>

<p>“I dare say. Are they hard to-day?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not so very hard; but, to tell the truth, I
thought there was to be some fun going on here
and I wanted to be on hand. My mother wrote
to the principal that she did not wish me to study
very hard, for something ailed my head.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the jar of the dummy will hurt your
head,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it won’t,” protested the candid Higgins.
“It feels better now than it did this morning; in
fact, it always feels better after school begins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p>“But I’m really afraid it will injure you to ride
on the dummy, with all the excitement of the highly
responsible position of conductor,” I added, gravely.
“I think I had better mention the matter to Major
Toppleton when I see him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; don’t do that,” pleaded Higgins, plaintively.
“Between you and me and the smoke-stack
of the dummy, I am as well as you are.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so; and I think the major understands
your malady, if the principal does not.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word this time, and I won’t ‘soger’
any more.”</p>

<p>“It’s none of my business, Higgins, but you are
sawing off your own nose, and playing the trick
upon yourself. I would be a man and face the
music like one, if I were you.”</p>

<p>“I will face the music if you won’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“All ready, Mr. Conductor!” I shouted, when
I had steam enough.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” yelled Higgins, rather glad to
change the subject when he found that I did not
appreciate his deception.</p>

<p>I ran the dummy out of the house, and stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
her near the head of the steamboat wharf. The
car was still so great a novelty that many people
gathered around to examine it. The cushions were
now well dried, and though the cloth had suffered
somewhat from the effects of the bath, it looked
very nice inside of her.</p>

<p>“Have you a watch, Higgins?” I asked of the
gentlemanly conductor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied he, producing a small gold one.</p>

<p>“We will leave Middleport on the hour, and
Spangleport on the half hour,” I added. “I wish I
had a watch.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you have one?”</p>

<p>“I’m not a rich man’s son, and I can’t afford to
have such playthings. But I suppose I must get
one, if I run on this dummy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you mine for to-day, Wolf.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I want to time the running, so as
to know where we are,” I answered, taking the
watch, and attaching the chain to my vest. “It is
nearly twelve o’clock, and we will start soon.”</p>

<p>“All aboard for Spangleport!” screamed Higgins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
as though the announcement was intended for the
people on the other side of the lake.</p>

<p>“Folks will understand that nothing ails your
lungs, Higgins, whatever is the matter with your
head,” I added, gently, to the zealous conductor.
“I wouldn’t yell so. Boys always make fools of
themselves by hallooing when there isn’t the least
need of it.”</p>

<p>Higgins, in a milder tone, invited the ladies and
gentlemen who were inspecting the car to step in
and make the excursion to Spangleport, promising
that they should return in just fifty minutes. Quite
a number of them accepted the invitation; and I
was about to start, when I saw a very beautiful
young lady hastening towards us. She was elegantly
dressed, and her movements were as graceful as
those of a fawn. The “gentlemanly conductor”
rang the bell for the engine to start, and the young
lady, hearing it, made a motion with her sunshade
for us to wait for her. I was too happy to find
she was to be a passenger in the car to start without
her, in spite of my laudable ambition to be “on
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span></p>

<p>The moment Higgins saw her, he jumped off the
platform, took off his cap, bowed and scraped like
a French dancing-master, and helped her up the
steps. There was a glass window in the partition
between the engine-room and the passenger compartment,
for which at that moment I felt extremely
grateful to the builder, for it enabled me to
obtain an occasional glance at the beautiful young
lady. I beg leave to say that this unwonted enthusiasm
on my part was as surprising to myself as it
will be to my readers, for I had hardly ever looked
at any person of the feminine persuasion before,
except my mother and sisters. I had certainly
never seen any lady who attracted me so strongly,
or for whom I felt so great an admiration. She
was not more than fifteen or sixteen years of age;
but she wore a long dress, and had a mature bearing.</p>

<p>Higgins conducted her to a seat, and she took
possession of it as gracefully as though she had been
schooled in the polite art for a whole lifetime. I
could not help gazing at her, and I envied Higgins
the rapture of being permitted to speak to her. She
looked around, and bowed to several persons in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the car, with the sweetest smile that ever lighted
up a young lady’s face. I was wholly absorbed in
gazing at her, and actually forgot that I was the
young engineer of the Lake Shore Railroad, till the
sharp snap of the bell brought me to my senses,
and assured me that Higgins was not so fascinated
as I was.</p>

<p>I was a minute behind time, and I let on the
steam to make it up. I was obliged to turn my
back on the beautiful being in the car, and look out
for “breakers ahead” through the door and windows
in the end of the engine-room; but I had the pleasing
satisfaction of thinking that in running backwards
from Spangleport I should face the other way.</p>

<p>What a fool I was! Of course I was. A young
man always has a time to be a fool, just as he has
to take the measles, though he seldom has it so
young as I did. I did not know who the young
lady was, and I did not crave any other privilege
than that of simply looking at her, just as I should
at a pretty picture. If she had fallen overboard, I
should certainly have jumped in after her. If she
had been in the claws of a lion, I should certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
have smitten the lion. If she had been in the upper
story of a house on fire, I should certainly have run
the risk of being singed for her sake. But she did
not fall overboard, or into the claws of a lion, and
she was not in a burning house; and, provoking as
it was, I could not do anything for her, except turn
my back to her,—and I was not sure that this
was not the most agreeable service I could render
her,—and run the dummy at its highest speed.</p>

<p>I could not help seeing the beautiful young lady
even through the back of my head; and I am sorry
to say that I forgot to look at my watch, when we
passed Ruggles’s barn and the Grass Brook bridge,
as I had intended; and at a quarter past twelve the
dummy sizzled into Spangleport, shivering like an
over-driven horse. I had the self-possession, however,
to stop her when she got there; but I have
since wondered that, under the circumstances, I did
not run her into the lake, or over the hill to Grass
Springs. I had made the distance in just fourteen
minutes.</p>

<p>The passengers got out of the car, and for a time
I lost sight of the elegant young lady. Higgins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
came round to me, and declared that we had made
a “bully trip.” I was entirely of his opinion; but
I was not willing to confess that a certain absentmindedness
had induced me to run the machine so
as to gain five minutes, and make up one. The
conductor left me, and I fancied that he had gone
to find the interesting person who had fascinated
me, and with whom he seemed to be acquainted.</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to get in there and see the
machinery?” said a silvery voice, while I was rubbing
up the works.</p>

<p>I turned, and my face felt as though all the steam
in the boiler had been discharged upon it when I
discovered that the speaker was no other than the
bewitching being who was uppermost in my thoughts.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied, leaping to the ground, and
endeavoring to imitate the polite gyrations of the
gentlemanly conductor.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Wolf,” added she, with the
sweetest of smiles.</p>

<p>Mr. Wolf! Involuntarily my head went up, and
I felt prouder of the handle to my name then when
the mighty major himself had applied it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will find the engine-room a very
dirty and greasy place,” I had the courage to suggest,
flustered as I was by having the beautiful girl
speak to me—actually speak to me!</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind! I have on my old clothes.”</p>

<p>If these were her old clothes, I wondered what
her best were.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know me, Mr. Wolf; but I
have heard a great deal about the young engineer,
and I assure you I am delighted to see you,” she
added, with a kind of roguish look, which made me
feel just as though I was “going up.” “I am
Grace Toppleton.”</p>

<p>The daughter of the major! I had heard what
a pretty, gentle, amiable girl she was, and I was positively
sure that the reports did not belie her.</p>

<p>“I have often heard of you, though I never had
the pleasure of seeing you before,” I replied, as gallantly
as my flustered state of mind would permit.</p>

<p>Still imitating the gentlemanly conductor, I took
her gloved hand, and attempted to help her up the
high step of the engine-room. I felt, at this particular
moment, just as though I was in the seventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
heaven. As the elegant young lady was about to
step up, a rude grasp was laid on my shoulder; so
rude that Miss Grace lost her foothold on the step,
and was thrown back upon the ground.</p>

<p>Turning round, I discovered that my rough assailant
was Captain Synders, the constable of Centreport.
He was attended by Colonel Wimpleton and the
skipper of the canal boat which had been blown up.
To my astonishment, Miss Grace leaped upon the
dummy without my help, and I was held back by
the savage grasp of the officer. My blissful dream
had suddenly been disturbed, and I was mad. The
envious Centreporters had chosen the moment of my
greatest joy to pounce upon me.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>SOME TALK WITH COLONEL WIMPLETON.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I was very intent upon explaining to Miss Grace
Toppleton the mysteries of the dummy engine,
and I was not pleased to have the agreeable interview
broken off. I was vexed, annoyed, and disconcerted.
The beautiful young lady looked at me, and
I thought I could see the indications of sympathy
upon her face.</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me a moment, Miss Toppleton,
I will show you the engine,” I said to her, with
all the politeness of which my nature was capable.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” added Captain Synders, with a
coarse grin, as though he had evil intentions in
regard to me.</p>

<p>“If you will let me, Mr. Wolf, I want to ride
back in the engine-room, and see the machinery
work,” replied she, in her silvery tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>“I guess not,” repeated Captain Synders; and I
turned my attention from her to him.</p>

<p>I could not conceive why Colonel Wimpleton and
his odious associate had chosen to come down upon
me at Spangleport, rather than Middleport, unless it
was because their appearance would make less excitement.
The boat in which they had come lay at the
wharf, and they must have started long before the
dummy left Middleport. Possibly they expected to
interrupt the trips of the engine, and have it left
five miles from its headquarters without an engineer.</p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton had with him Captain Synders,
the constable. It had not yet occurred to me
that I should actually be arrested, and held to
answer for the destruction of the honest skipper’s
canal boat, though the appearance of the officer had
suggested the idea to me. They could not arrest
me without including Waddie in the warrant, for he
had confessed his agency in the mischief. I did not
know of any way by which I could be punished
without involving the scion of the great house on
the other side.</p>

<p>“What do you wish with me?” I asked, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
very ill-natured tone; for I beg to remind the reader
that I am human, and that Miss Toppleton occupied
the engine-room of the car.</p>

<p>Captain Synders glanced at the colonel, as though
he expected him to do the talking, and that distinguished
gentleman looked down upon me with
unutterable severity. The honest skipper did not
appear to have much sympathy with his companions,
and looked very pleasant for a man who had experienced
so heavy a loss as that of his canal boat.</p>

<p>“Wolf!” said the colonel, in stern and lofty
accents.</p>

<p>“Sir!” I replied, with a dignity becoming the
engineer of the Lake Shore Railroad.</p>

<p>“We have been looking for you,” he added,
glancing at the constable, as if to direct my attention
to him.</p>

<p>“You have been lucky enough to find me, sir. I
wish to say, sir, that the car starts for Middleport
at half-past twelve, and therefore I have only ten
minutes to spare,” I replied, consulting Higgins’s
gold watch, the appearance of which, I think, produced
a sensation in the minds of my visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span></p>

<p>“Humph! I think you will wait my pleasure.”</p>

<p>“That will depend somewhat upon the length of
time your pleasure demands my presence. Will you
please to tell me what you want of me?”</p>

<p>“Where is your father, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“At Middleport, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is he doing there?”</p>

<p>“He is at work, sir.”</p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton looked as though he wanted
to swear; for I am sorry to say this influential man
sometimes indulged in the wicked habit of using
profane language. It did not seem quite proper that
the menial, whom he had discharged as a punishment,
should find work so soon.</p>

<p>“What is he doing?” demanded the magnate of
Centreport, biting his lips to conceal his vexation.</p>

<p>“You were so kind as to make an opening for
him, sir, by hiring away Major Toppleton’s engineer,
and my father has taken his place, at the same wages—eighty
dollars a month—as you pay your new
engineer.”</p>

<p>The great man stamped his foot with rage, and
uttered an expression with which I cannot soil my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
paper. As wicked, tyrannical, overbearing men often
do, he had overreached himself in his anxiety to
strike my father. If it was unchristian for me to
rejoice in his discomfiture, I could not help it, and
I did so most heartily.</p>

<p>“I have been to see him about your conduct,”
continued the colonel, when his wrath would let him
speak again. “I want to know what he is going
to do about paying his share of the loss of the canal
boat which you and Waddie blew up?”</p>

<p>“I can speak for him, sir, if that is all you want.
He is not going to pay the first cent of it,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Here is the captain of the boat, and he wants
to know what you are going to do about it,” added
the colonel, trying to enjoy the confusion which he
thought I ought to feel in view of such a demand.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to know who is going to pay for
the mischief,” said the honest skipper; but as he
already knew, he did not put much heart into the
words, and actually chuckled as he uttered them.</p>

<p>“Captain,” I continued, turning to the master of
the canal boat, “I say to you, as I have said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
others, that I had nothing whatever to do with
blowing up your boat, and I did not know anything
about it till the explosion took place. That is all
I have to say.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it,” replied the
skipper.</p>

<p>“I do,” interposed the colonel. “He has confessed
that he had hold of the string when the boat
blew up.”</p>

<p>I took the trouble to explain to the honest skipper
that Waddie had asked me to pull in his kite
line; that I had picked it up, but, fearing some
trick, had done nothing with it; and that Waddie
had pulled the string himself.</p>

<p>“All aboard for Middleport!” shouted Higgins, as
moderately this time as a gentlemanly conductor
should speak.</p>

<p>“My time is nearly up, sir,” I added to the colonel.
“If you have any further business with me,
please to state it as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“You must go over to Centreport with me, and
arrange this business,” replied the magnate, gruffly.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I cannot do that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span></p>

<p>“Then Captain Synders must arrest you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir; let him do so. I am willing to
go to jail and stand trial on the blowing up. Have
you made a complaint against me?” I asked of the
honest skipper.</p>

<p>He was too candid to tell a lie, and he made me
no answer.</p>

<p>“Have you a warrant for my arrest?” I demanded
of Captain Synders.</p>

<p>“I can take you without a warrant,” growled the
constable.</p>

<p>“Do so, then. If you wish to arrest me, I will
submit.”</p>

<p>My friends may think I was putting a very bold
face upon the matter, but I candidly admit that I
should have been glad to have the charge against
me investigated; though I was very certain no steps
would be taken in that direction. It is possible
Colonel Wimpleton believed that I had been concerned
with his hopeful in the blowing up of the
canal boat; yet the guilt of his son was settled, and,
if convicted, some stupid judge might sentence us
both to the penitentiary, for the case would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
go to the shire town of the county, out of the reach
of the great man’s influence, for trial.</p>

<p>My father had told me that, at the interview with
the colonel in the night, the latter had threatened
him with prosecution for abusing his son; but when
my father suggested that Waddie had broken into
his house in the night time, it was plain enough that
the young gentleman was liable to a turn in the
state prison. Waddie’s crimes and mistakes continually
stood in the way of his taking his revenge.
I considered myself fully protected in the same
manner.</p>

<p>“Captain Synders, if you are going to arrest me,
please to do it at once,” I added, as the lady passengers
began to get into the car, and some of the
gentlemen came up to the spot where I stood.</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” asked Higgins.</p>

<p>“These gentlemen from the other side talk of
taking me up for the mischief to that canal boat.
If they do so, Higgins, I want you to go to my
father, and tell him about it. If I mistake not,
Waddie Wimpleton will be arrested before night for
breaking into our house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” exclaimed the enthusiastic conductor.</p>

<p>“Arrest Waddie!” ejaculated the colonel, gnashing
his teeth with rage.</p>

<p>It was mortifying to the great man to find that
he had come to the end of his rope; that even his
power to annoy and persecute his inferiors had a
limit.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” repeated Higgins.</p>

<p>“If you are going to arrest me, Captain Synders,
now is your time,” I added.</p>

<p>The people who had gathered around us began to
laugh and enjoy the scene, and, being mostly Middleporters,
they had no particular sympathy for the
colonel.</p>

<p>“Wolf, we shall meet again,” said the great man,
sullenly, as he turned upon his heel, and, followed
by his companions, walked rapidly down to the
wharf, where his boat lay.</p>

<p>Even while I knew his power, and felt that he
could annoy our family, and perhaps ruin us, I was
quite ready to meet him again. Waddie’s indiscretions
stood between me and his wrath for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
present, but his time might come. I leaped into
the engine-room of the dummy, where Miss Toppleton
had stood listening to our conversation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolf, I think you are real smart,” said she,
with a sweet smile of approbation.</p>

<p>“I thank you, Miss Toppleton, for your good
opinion. Colonel Wimpleton is very hard upon me
just now.”</p>

<p>“I heard father tell about it. I think that Colonel
Wimpleton is a real wicked man; and I only wonder
that he and father were good friends for so many
years.”</p>

<p>“I am all ready to start now,” I added. “I wish
I had better accommodations for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is very nice!” exclaimed she.</p>

<p>I opened the valve, and let on the steam.</p>

<p>“What did you do then?” she asked, pointing to
the handle of the valve.</p>

<p>“I let on the steam;” and then I gave her a full
description of the engine, which was hardly finished
when we came in sight of Middleport.</p>

<p>I found it a delightful task to expatiate on my
favorite theme to such a beautiful and interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
listener, and I pointed out the cylinder wherein the
piston worked, the connecting rod which moved the
crank, and showed her how the valves which admitted
the steam to the cylinder were worked. I
flattered myself, after the lesson I had given her,
that she was almost competent to run the dummy
herself.</p>

<p>“I think it is real nice to ride in here, and see
the machinery move,” said she.</p>

<p>“So do I; and I enjoy it very much; more just
now, I fear, than I ever shall again.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” she asked, innocently.</p>

<p>I was not quite bold enough to explain the principal
reason, and so I replied that it was a new
thing to me.</p>

<p>“I hope you will let me ride with you again,
some time,” she added.</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure,” I replied. “Whenever
you please.”</p>

<p>We ran into Middleport, and Miss Toppleton
thanked me very prettily for my kindness in showing
her about the engine; and I really wished I had it
to do over again. By this time the students were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
turned out of school, and all of them gathered around
the dummy, anxious to begin the afternoon’s fun. I
had brought over my dinner, and I ate it before
the next trip. At one o’clock I was ready to start
for Spangleport again.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>THE CONSTRUCTION TRAIN.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I have been so busy with the history of our
family affairs, and the incidents which sent me
over to Middleport, that I have not had much to
say about the Lake Shore Railroad; but before I
have done with the subject, I shall fully describe
the road, and explain the operations of the company.
Only a small portion of the line had yet been built,
and the dummy was but a temporary substitute for
more complete rolling stock. Major Toppleton intended
to have a charter for the road, to be obtained
at the next session of the legislature, and to continue
it to Ucayga. Although it was at the present
time a mere plaything for the students, it was designed
to be a useful institution, and to build up
Middleport immensely in the end.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to start on the one o’clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
trip, Major Toppleton presented himself. The car
was filled with students, though a number of ladies
and gentlemen had come down to the station to
have a ride in the dummy. The major immediately
ordered the boys to evacuate the premises,
which they did with some grumblings, amounting
almost to rebellion. The persons waiting were invited
to get in, and I started for Spangleport with
a less noisy crowd than I had anticipated. As we
went off, I heard the major call the students together,
and I concluded that he had some definite
plan to carry out.</p>

<p>On my return, I found the boys had loaded up
the two platform cars with rails and sleepers, and
they were attached to the dummy as soon as she
arrived. Several mechanics were standing by, and
it was evident that a piece of work was to be done
that day, instead of play.</p>

<p>“Now, Wolf, we will run a construction train on
this trip,” said Major Toppleton, as he took his place
at my side on the dummy, and directed the students
and the mechanics to load themselves into the passenger
apartment and on the cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p>“I think we need a little more construction at
Spangleport, sir,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to run backwards, sir, on the down
trips.”</p>

<p>“But a turn-table will cost too much for the short
time we shall make Spangleport a terminus. We
will build one at Grass Springs, for that will be as
far as we shall run the road this season.”</p>

<p>“We need not build a turn-table, sir,” I added.
“We can turn the dummy on switches.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” inquired the major.</p>

<p>“It will take three switches to turn her. First
run a track round a curve to the right, until it
comes to a right angle with the main line. Then
run another track on the reverse curve till it strikes
the main line again, a few rods from the point where
the first track leaves it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“I will explain it when we stop, sir. It will not
take long to lay it down, and when it is no longer
wanted it can be taken up, and put down in another
place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span></p>

<p>At Spangleport, where we stopped, I made a diagram
on a piece of paper, to illustrate my plan; and
here is a copy of my drawing. The perpendicular
lines are the main track. The dummy was to be
switched off at the lowest part of the diagram, and
run on the curve till it had passed a switch on the
right. Then it was to be switched on the upper
curve, and run back till it passed the switch on the
main line, which being shifted, the car having been
turned entirely round, it runs back on the perpendicular
lines between the curves.</p>

<figure class='figcenter' id='i_242'>
  <img class='w20' src='images/i_242.jpg' alt="Wolf's track diagram">

<p>Major Toppleton was satisfied with the scheme,
directed that the switches should be brought up,
and the work was commenced at once by the mechanics.
All the boys but two were employed in
laying down more track; but I am sorry to say
they grumbled fiercely, for they wanted to have
some fun with the dummy. Higgins was still to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
serve as conductor, and the other student who had
been excepted from hard labor was one of the regularly
appointed engineers of the road. His name
was Faxon. He had some taste for mechanics, and
had distinguished himself in school by making a
fine diagram of the steam-engine on the blackboard.
He was to run with me on the dummy,
and learn to manage the engine. I was directed
to post him up, as well as I could, and to permit
him to take an active part in running the machine.</p>

<p>I was not particularly pleased with the idea of
an apprentice in the engine-room with me, for if
the fellow had any “gumption” he would soon be
able to take my place, and I might be discharged
whenever it was convenient. But a second thought
assured me that my fears were mean and unworthy;
that I could never succeed in making myself useful
by keeping others in ignorance. The students were
sent to the Institute to learn, and the railroad was
a part of their means of instruction. I had no right
to be selfish.</p>

<p>We ran down to the wharf in Spangleport, for
the road was built half a mile beyond the village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
when Higgins shouted, “All aboard for Middleport!”
We had quite a crowd of Spangleporters
as passengers, and we ran our trips regularly till
five o’clock, to the great gratification of the people
of both places, when the gentlemanly conductor declined
to receive any more who expected to return,
as the half-past five car up would be a construction
train. Mr. Higgins talked very glibly and professionally
by this time, and imitated all the gentlemanly
conductors he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Faxon was a very good fellow, though he cherished
a bitter antipathy against the Wimpletonians,
and everything connected with them. He was an
ardent admirer of Major Toppleton, and particularly
of Major Toppleton’s eldest daughter, for which I did
not like him any the less, strange as it may appear
after the developments of the last chapter.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, Wolf,” said he, as we
were running up the last trip, “this thing won’t go
down with the fellows.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“All the fellows are mad because they had to
work this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p>“I thought they considered it fun to build the
road.”</p>

<p>“They did before the dummy came; but now
they want the fun of the thing. They are all rich
men’s sons, and they won’t stand it to work like
Irish laborers. I hope there won’t be any row.”</p>

<p>“Of course Major Toppleton knows what he is
about.”</p>

<p>“The students don’t growl before him. They do
it to the teachers, who dare not say their souls are
their own.”</p>

<p>“But the major told me the boys enjoyed the
fun, and insisted upon building the road themselves
when he wanted to employ laborers for the purpose.”</p>

<p>“That’s played out. I heard some of the fellows
say they would not work another day.”</p>

<p>“Some one ought to tell the major about this.
He don’t want them to work if they don’t like it,”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“It was fine fun when we first began to dig, and
lay rails, but we have all got about enough of it.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to the major about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t say anything to-day,” interposed Faxon.
“The students are vexed because they were not
allowed to have a good time this afternoon; but
the major is going to have a great picnic at Sandy
Shore next week, and he is in a hurry to have the
road built to that point—two miles beyond Spangleport.”</p>

<p>“There is only one mile more to build, and if the
fellows stick to it they will get it done.”</p>

<p>“But they say they won’t work another day,” replied
Faxon.</p>

<p>Middleport was not paradise any more than Centreport.
Boys were just as foolish and just as willing
to get into a scrape, on one side as the other.
The Toppletonians had insisted upon doing the work
of building the road, and then purposed to rebel because
they were required to do it. I had heard of
the grand picnic which was to take place on the
occasion of the birthday of Miss Grace Toppleton.
The grove by the Sandy Shore could be reached
most conveniently by the railroad, and the major’s
anxiety to have the rails laid to that point had induced
him to drive the work, instead of giving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
students a chance to have a good time with the
dummy, as they had desired to do while it was a
new thing.</p>

<p>We ran into the engine-house, and some of the
boys forced their way into my quarters, in spite of
my protest. I saw a couple of them studying the
machinery with deep interest. They asked me some
questions; and supposing they were only gratifying
a reasonable curiosity, I gave them all the information
they needed, telling them just how to manage
the engine.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I can do that as well as anybody,” said
Briscoe, as he jumped down.</p>

<p>“Of course you can,” replied one of his companions.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I could run her, Wolf?” asked
Briscoe. “I am one of the engineers of the road,
and I ought to know how.”</p>

<p>“Probably you could after you had had some
experience.”</p>

<p>They went away, and I wondered what they
were thinking about. It did not much matter,
however, for I was satisfied that the major would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
not permit them to run the engine till they had
become thoroughly competent to do so. I put out
the fires in the dummy, cleaned the machinery, and
left her in readiness for use the next morning. I
then went to the mills; and, as my father had
finished his day’s work, we walked down to the
wharf where my skiff lay. On the way I told him
about my interview with Colonel Wimpleton, and
we both enjoyed the great man’s confusion when
he learned in what manner he had punished my
father.</p>

<p>“He will not arrest you, Wolf; you may depend
upon that,” said my father. “As the case now
stands, we have the weather-gauge on him, except
in the matter of the mortgage. I am afraid I shall
lose all I have in the house. Mortimer has got
back, but he hasn’t seen or heard of Christy.”</p>

<p>“He may turn up yet.”</p>

<p>“He may, but I don’t depend much upon it. I
have tried a little here in Middleport to raise the
money to pay off the mortgage; but people here
will not lend anything on real estate on the other
side of the lake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps Major Toppleton will help you out,” I
suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to say anything to him about it.
He has done well by me, and I won’t ride a free
horse to death; besides, I don’t want to be in the
power of either one of these rich men. I have had
trouble enough on the other side.”</p>

<p>I pulled across the lake, and we went into the
house. My mother looked anxiously at my father
as he entered, and then at me. I smiled, and she
understood me. Father <ins id='c249' title='original: had not drank'>had not drunk</ins> a drop, and
she was happy. We never relished our supper any
better than we did that night, and I went to bed
early, not a little surprised that we heard nothing,
during the evening, of Colonel Wimpleton and
his son.</p>

<p>The dummy was to make her first trip at eight
o’clock, and I left the house at half-past six, with
my father, to cross the lake. When we reached
the wharf, I was utterly confounded to see the
dummy streaking it at the rate of twenty miles an
hour along the opposite shore of the lake. Something
was wrong, for there was no one on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
other side who knew how to run the machine,
unless it was Faxon, and I was afraid the discontented
Toppletonians were in mischief. We embarked
in the skiff, and I pulled over as quickly
as I had done the day before.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>OFF THE TRACK.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>The appearance of the dummy, going at full
speed, filled me with anxiety. I was sure that
something was wrong, for I knew that Major Toppleton
was not stirring at that hour in the morning,
and that he could not have given any one permission
to take out the car without telling me of it.
I hastened up to the engine-house; but it was
empty, and added nothing to my meagre stock of
ideas on the vexed subject. The dummy was gone,
and that was all I knew about it.</p>

<p>The Institute buildings were only a short distance
from the engine-house, and I next went there in
search of information. The students were engaged,
in large numbers, in their sports. Indeed, there
were so many of them present that the suspicion
I had entertained that some of the boys had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
on a lark in the dummy seemed to be disarmed.
Still, a dozen or twenty of them would not be
missed in the crowd, and it was possible that this
number were in mischief, though I thought, if it
were so, they had chosen a singular time of day
for it.</p>

<p>The students were rung up in the morning at six
o’clock; but, by a merciful provision of the governors
of the Institute, the first hour was devoted to
play, so that those who were behind time cheated
themselves out of just so much sport. I was informed
that only a few neglected to get up when
the bell rang; and I commend this humane and
cunning arrangement to other institutions troubled
by the matutinal tardiness of students. The morning
is favorable to bold schemes and active movements;
and the more I thought of the matter, the
more anxious I became to know whose places
would be vacant at the breakfast table, at seven
o’clock, when the bell rang for the morning meal.</p>

<p>I inquired for Faxon, and soon found him making
a “home run” in a game of base ball. Before
I had time to address him the breakfast bell rang;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
and with a most surprising unanimity, all games
were instantly suspended—a fact which ought to
convince humanitarian educators that breakfast, dinner,
and supper should immediately follow play, if
boys are to be taught habits of promptness. The
students rushed towards “Grub Hall,” as the dining-room
was called; but, though Faxon had a good
appetite, I succeeded, with some difficulty, in intercepting
his headlong flight.</p>

<p>“What’s the row, Wolf?” demanded he, glancing
at the open door through which the boys were filing
to the breakfast table, and possibly fearing that the
delay would involve an inferior piece of beefsteak.</p>

<p>“Are any of the fellows missing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not that I know of; but we can tell at the
table,” replied he. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“The dummy is gone,” I answered, mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Gone! Gone where?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I saw her streaking it down the
road as if she had been shot off.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word about it; but hold on here
till I get my grub, and see who is missing,” said
he, rushing into the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span></p>

<p>I did not understand what Faxon purposed to do;
but I was willing to comply with the arrangement,
in compassion for his stomach, if for no other reason.
I had feared that my associate on the engine
was concerned in the conspiracy to abstract the
dummy, for I did not think any one else would be
able to manage it. I was glad to find he had not
engaged in the lark, and I wondered all the more
who had the audacity to play with the machine. I
walked over to a point on the Institute grounds
which commanded a view of the Lake Shore for
some distance; but I could see nothing of the
dummy. Presently, Faxon, who had satisfied the
cravings of his hunger in a remarkably short time,
came out of the building.</p>

<p>“Briscoe and half a dozen other fellows are missing,”
said he.</p>

<p>“Briscoe!” I exclaimed; for he was the fellow
who had invaded my quarters the night before, and
declared he could handle the engine.</p>

<p>“He’s a first-rate fellow, in the main, and I hope
he isn’t getting into any scrape,” added Faxon, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid he is. He is the fellow who has run
away with the dummy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word. I have permission to be out
an hour, and we will see where they are. What
can we do?”</p>

<p>“We can take one of the platform cars, and go
after them.”</p>

<p>“Come along; but don’t say anything.”</p>

<p>We went to the engine-house, and lifted one of
the platform cars on the track. The Lake Shore
Railroad, as I had found by running the dummy,
had a slight descent from Middleport to Spangleport.
We pushed the car, running behind it, till we had
worked it up to a high rate of speed, and then leaped
upon the platform. The impetus thus given to it
kept it going for a mile, when the motive power
was applied again, as before. In this manner we
ran three miles, without making very hard work of
it, and came in sight of the dummy.</p>

<p>“There she is!” exclaimed Faxon. “The fellows
did not go a great way in her.”</p>

<p>“No! but they went as far as they could,” I
replied, as soon as I had examined the situation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the car, which was not in motion when we discovered
it.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“She’s off the track.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!”</p>

<p>For my own part I was rather glad the enterprise
of the runaways had been nipped in the bud, for I
had a professional contempt for those who attempt
to run an engine when they know nothing about
one. I only hoped the dummy and the boys were
not injured. As we approached nearer to the scene
of the disaster, we saw the conspirators hard at
work trying to get the dummy on the track.</p>

<p>“What are you about, you spoonies!” shouted
Faxon, as we stopped the car close to the unfortunate
dummy.</p>

<p>“We are trying to get the thing on the track,”
replied Briscoe, as coolly as though he had done
nothing wrong.</p>

<p>“How came she out here?” demanded Faxon.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we were having a little fun with her.”</p>

<p>“You were missed at breakfast, and you will
catch fits for this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose we shall; but we can’t help it now.”</p>

<p>“What did you meddle with her for, you spoonies,
when you didn’t know anything about her?”
continued Faxon, indignantly.</p>

<p>“I know all about her, as well as you do, Faxon.
You needn’t put on airs because you helped run
the thing,” retorted Briscoe.</p>

<p>“I should think you did know all about her; and
that’s the reason why you ran her off the track. You
don’t know so much as you think you do.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but I know more than you think
I do.”</p>

<p>“What did you run her off for?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is considered rather necessary to
have rails for this thing to run on,” replied Briscoe.
“If you will look ahead of her, you will see that
the track is torn up for a quarter of a mile, and the
rails carried off.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” added Faxon, walking out ahead
of the dummy.</p>

<p>“That’s so, as you may see for yourself,” said
Briscoe, following us along the track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p>“Who did it? That’s the next question,” asked
Faxon, vexed, as we all were, at the discovery.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; we didn’t,” answered Briscoe.
“If the track hadn’t been pulled up, we should have
returned at breakfast time. What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“You must get back as quick as you can,” replied
the benevolent Faxon. “I won’t blow on you.
Take that car, and make time for the Institute.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good fellow, Faxon,” added Briscoe,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“If I am, don’t you play this game again.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, again.”</p>

<p>“How did it work?” I inquired, wishing to hear
the experience of the runaways.</p>

<p>“First rate. I had no trouble with it. She
started when I pulled the thing, and we made time
on her coming down, you had better believe.”</p>

<p>“I should think you did. I saw you putting her
through by daylight.”</p>

<p>“Edwards saw the track was gone, and told me
of it. I shut off steam, and put on the brakes;
but I couldn’t fetch up soon enough to keep from
running off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span></p>

<p>“All I have to say is, that you are lucky to come
out of it with a whole skin,” I added, solemnly.
“But hurry back as fast as you can, or you will
be in hot water.”</p>

<p>“I’m in hot water now, and I may as well be
scalded with a quart as a pint. I am willing to
stay and help you put her on the track.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it, Briscoe,” interposed Faxon. “You
are one of the directors, and if the major finds out
you meddled with the dummy, he will have you
turned out of office. Rush back to the Institute,
and don’t let on.”</p>

<p>The runaways were willing to adopt this advice.
There were half a dozen of them, and as they could
make easy work of pushing the car back, they soon
disappeared behind the trees.</p>

<p>“You won’t let on—will you, Wolf?” said Faxon,
in a coaxing tone, as soon as we were alone.</p>

<p>“I won’t volunteer to tell any stories out of
school; but I shall not tell any lies about it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be squeamish. Briscoe is a good fellow,
and one of the directors. The major would break
him if he heard of this thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>“Between you and me, I think he ought to be
broken. Suppose they had burst the boiler, and
been wiped out themselves?”</p>

<p>“That’s all very pretty; but they didn’t burst the
boiler, and were not wiped out.”</p>

<p>“I’m at work for Major Toppleton. If he asks me
any questions, I shall tell him the truth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think he is likely to ask me any
questions. There will be a breeze when he finds
out the track has been torn up, and there will be
fog enough with it to cover up those fellows.”</p>

<p>“Be a good fellow, Wolf, and don’t say a word.”</p>

<p>“I will not if I can help it. I don’t think anybody
will know anything about this scrape. Those
who saw the dummy come out will suppose I was
on her. But here’s a pretty kettle of fish!” I
added, glancing at the dummy, and then at the
road minus the rails.</p>

<p>“Can we put the thing on the track again?”</p>

<p>“I think we can—we can try it, at least. We
want some of those rails for levers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span></p>

<p>“Where are they?” asked the puzzled Faxon.
“Did some one steal them for old iron?”</p>

<p>“No; they are not far off,” I replied, leading the
way down to the Lake Shore.</p>

<p>We walked along the beach, till I discovered footsteps
in the sand.</p>

<p>“Here is where they landed,” I added, pointing
to the prints, and also to some deep lines gored in
the sand by a couple of boats, which had been
hauled up on the beach.</p>

<p>“Who landed? I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“I do; an enemy has done this. The Wimpletonians
have been over here during the night and
torn up your track.”</p>

<p>“If they did, it will be a sorry day for them,”
said Faxon, grating his teeth and shaking his head.</p>

<p>“These footprints were made by dandy boots, and
all the party were boys. It’s as plain as the nose
on Colonel Wimpleton’s face;” and the great man
of Centreport was troubled with a long proboscis.</p>

<p>“They’ll catch it for this.”</p>

<p>We walked along till we came to Grass Brook,
and there we found the rails thrown into the deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
water at the mouth of it. The end of one of them
lay within my reach, and I pulled it out. Using
this as a lever, we pried up the wheels of the
dummy, and, after an hour of severe exertion, we
succeeded in putting the car upon the track.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>THE GRAND PICNIC.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>It is not necessary for me to quote any of the
big words which Major Toppleton used when I
told him the Wimpletonians had been over and
torn up a quarter of a mile of the track of the
Lake Shore Railroad. I did not deem it best, as
he asked no questions, to augment his wrath by
telling him the dummy had been off the track. He
was more impatient, if possible, to have the road
completed than the boys were. He procured the
services of a score of mechanics and laborers, and
we hastened with them to the dismantled portion of
the road. The rails were fished up from the deep
water, and before twelve o’clock the track was in as
good order as ever.</p>

<p>If the students of the Wimpleton Institute looked
over the lake, and enjoyed the mischief they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
done,—as of course they did,—their satisfaction was
of short duration. Before they were turned out to
play in the afternoon, the dummy was running her
regular trips to Spangleport. I have no doubt the
rascals who did the mischief felt cheap and crestfallen
when they saw the car going on its way as
though nothing had happened; and I had no more
doubt that they would consider their work ill done,
and attempt to do it over again. They were not
allowed to go out nights; but I am afraid the
authorities of the Institute did not punish them
very severely when they broke through the rules in
order to do mischief to the establishment on the
other side. It was only following the example of
the magnate of Centreport and many of their elders;
and “like master, like man.”</p>

<p>When the torn-up track was relaid, the twenty
men were conveyed beyond Spangleport to build the
road. Frogs and switches had been procured, the
turning apparatus was finished, and I had the pleasure
of running both ways in ship-shape style. By
laying a few rods of track, and putting down a
couple of switches near the engine-house, we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
enabled to turn at the Middleport end. We always
switched off to run into the engine-house, and we
had to back in, from a point <i>above</i> the house. On
the new track we ran out to a point <i>below</i>, and came
upon the main line headed towards Spangleport. I
take the more pride in describing these movements,
because they were of my own invention, though I
have since learned that similar plans had been used
before.</p>

<p>Towards night on the second day of my railroad
experience, Major Toppleton was a passenger in the
engine-room. He was in high spirits to think the
mischief done by the Wimpletonians had been so
speedily repaired; but he was afraid the daring act
would be repeated, as I was quite satisfied it would.
I knew my late comrades on the Centreport side
well enough to understand that they would never
let the Lake Shore Railroad enjoy peace and prosperity
until they were provided with an equivalent.
I was confident that Colonel Wimpleton was racking
his brains even then for a scheme which would produce
an equal excitement among the students of
his Institute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span></p>

<p>“You know those villains over there better than
I do, Wolf,” said the major confidentially to me;
and I was amazed to hear him own that I knew
anything better than he did. “Don’t you think they
will attempt to tear up the track again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I do think so,” I replied.</p>

<p>“The rascals! It mortifies me to have them get
ahead of me in this manner. If I could only catch
them, I would cure them of night wandering very
quick. It is of no use for me to complain to the
colonel, or to the principal of the Wimpleton Institute.
They would enjoy my chagrin.”</p>

<p>“It is easy enough to prevent them from doing
any more mischief,” I added.</p>

<p>“How?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“By setting a watch.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and while we are watching in one place
they will tear up the rails in another.”</p>

<p>“There are two ways to do it. Your tow-boat
can ply up and down the shore, or we can run the
dummy all night.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can stand it to run the dummy
all night, Wolf?” laughed he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>

<p>“My father and I could for a few nights.”</p>

<p>The tow-boat had gone up the lake with a fleet
of canal boats, and the other plan was the only
alternative. I saw my father at six o’clock. He was
ready to serve on the watch, but he was not willing
to leave my mother alone with my sisters at home
all night, fearful that some of the chivalrous Wimpletonians
might undertake to annoy her. But Faxon
volunteered to serve with me, and was pleased with
the idea. We lighted up the reflecting lamp over
the door of the engine, and, though it was dark,
we put her “through by daylight,” in a figurative
sense.</p>

<p>We talked till we were sleepy, and then by turns
each of us took a nap, lying upon the cushions of
the passenger compartment. It was a good bed, and
we enjoyed the novelty of the situation. Faxon by
this time understood the machinery very well, and I
was not afraid to trust him. We did not run on
regular hours, and lay still more than half the time,
after Faxon had run the car as much as he desired.
We kept an eye on the lake for boats, of which the
Wimpletonians had a whole squadron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p>Only once during the night was there anything
like an alarm. We saw half a dozen boats come
down through the Narrows about eleven o’clock,
but we soon lost sight of them under the shadow
of the opposite shore. We saw nothing more of
them, and I concluded that the dummy, with her
bright light on the shore, had prevented another
attack upon the railroad. After this all was quiet,
and there was nothing to get up an excitement
upon.</p>

<p>The next day I was rather sleepy at times, and so
was Faxon. At eight o’clock the major appeared,
and I told him we had probably prevented another
raid upon the road, for we had seen a fleet of boats
pass through the Narrows.</p>

<p>“All right, Wolf; I am glad we balked the scoundrels,”
answered the major; and almost anything
seemed to be a victory to the great man of Middleport.</p>

<p>“I suppose they will try again some other time,”
I added.</p>

<p>“We will see that they don’t succeed. Now we
must push along the road as fast as we can. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
like to disappoint the boys, but I can’t wait for them
to build the rest of it.”</p>

<p>I could not help smiling.</p>

<p>“What is it, Wolf?” he asked, smiling with me;
and great men’s smiles are sunshine to the heart.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they will cry if you don’t let them
do any more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? Why, they begged me to let them do
the work with their own hands, and I have gratified
them thus far.”</p>

<p>I soon convinced him that the boys were not
anxious to do any more digging, or to lay any more
rails; that hard work was “played out” with them.
The magnate was delighted to hear it; and there
was no grumbling because the students were not
called upon to use the shovels and the hammers.
I ran the dummy out with the men, after that, every
morning at seven o’clock, and the road progressed
rapidly towards Grass Springs.</p>

<p>At noon we heard astounding news from Centreport.
All the boats belonging to the Wimpleton
Institute—not less than a dozen of them—had
mysteriously disappeared. No one knew what had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
happened to them, and no one had heard anything
in the night to indicate what had become of them.
Major Toppleton inquired very particularly about the
fleet of boats Faxon and I had seen; but our information
did not elucidate the mystery. I observed
that my fellow-engineer winked at me very significantly,
as though he knew more than he chose to tell.</p>

<p>“What did you wink for, Faxon?” I asked, when
we started on our trip, and were alone.</p>

<p>“You are blind as the major,” laughed he.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“About forty of the Toppletonians found a way to
get out of the Institute last night. You won’t say
a word about this—will you?”</p>

<p>“You had better not tell me, Faxon.”</p>

<p>“But I will tell you, for I don’t think the major
or the principal will say anything if the whole thing
is blown. You know where the quarries are, above
Centreport, on that side.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“The Wimpleton boats, loaded with rocks, and
the plugs taken out, lie at the bottom of the lake,
in twenty feet of water, off the quarries. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
even with those fellows now for tearing up our
track.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Too bad! It wasn’t too bad to tear up our
track—was it?” replied he, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Two wrongs don’t make a right,” I replied,
sagely.</p>

<p>“But one evil sometimes corrects another—‘<i>similia
similibus curantur</i>,’ as our little-pill doctor used
to say. The loss of their boats will prevent the
Wimps from coming over here again in the night
to cut up our road.”</p>

<p>I was a boy, like the rest of them; but I did
not exactly enjoy this “tit for tat” business. My
mother had always taught me to exercise a Christian
spirit, and this “paying back” was a diabolical
spirit. I would not tell of these things, nor suffer
my readers to gloat over them, if any are disposed
to do so—were it not to show how these two
great men, and all the little men who hung upon
the skirts of their coats, were finally reconciled to
each other; and how, out of war and vengeance,
came “peace and good will to men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span></p>

<p>Before Miss Grace Toppleton’s birthday arrived
the road was finished to Sandy Beach, and the
grand picnic took place. The two platform cars
had seats built upon them, and were attached to
the dummy. I conveyed about a hundred a trip
until the middle of the day, when all Middleport
appeared to have been transported to the
grove. The affair was very elaborate in all its
details. Tents, pavilions, booths, and swings had
been erected, and the Ucayga Cornet Band was on
the ground.</p>

<p>When I came in on the twelve o’clock trip, my
father presented himself at the door of the engine-room,
his face wreathed in smiles. My mother and
sisters were present, for we were now regarded as
Middleporters.</p>

<p>“I will take care of this thing for a short time,
Wolf, and you may go and see the fun,” said my
father.</p>

<p>“I don’t care about going now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must go; the people want to see you.”</p>

<p>Thus urged I entered the grove, and found myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
before a speaker’s stand, on which Major Toppleton
was holding forth to the people.</p>

<p>“Come here, Wolf!” called he. “I want to see
you.”</p>

<p>A couple of the students seized me by the arms,
and, dragging me forward, actually forced me up the
steps upon the speaker’s stand. I blushed, was bewildered
and confused.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Wolf!” shouted Faxon; and
they were given.</p>

<p>“Come forward, Wolf. The people want to see
you,” added the major, dragging me to the front of
the stage.</p>

<p>I blushed, and tried to escape; and then the great
man jumped down, and left me alone on the platform.
I took off my cap, and bowed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolf.”</p>

<p>I turned. Miss Grace Toppleton was on the stage
with me. I looked at her with wonder.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolf,” she continued, “the students of the
Toppleton Institute, grateful to you for your labors
on the Lake Shore Railroad, wish to present you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
this gold watch; and I assure you it affords me
very great pleasure to be the bearer of this token
to you.”</p>

<p>She handed me the watch, and I took it, with a
red face and a trembling hand.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>WOLF’S SPEECH.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>I was never so “taken aback” in my life as
when I heard the silvery voice of Miss Grace
Toppleton, and saw the magnificent gift in her hand.
At any time I should have looked at her with interest;
but just then it seemed to me that the sun
had ceased to shine, and all the light which flowed
down upon the brilliant scene around me came from
her beautiful face. I wished there was a hole in
the platform beneath me, through which I might
sink out of sight; but then, I am sure, if I had
gone down into the gloom of the space beneath
me, I should instantly have wished myself back
again; for I was the hero of the occasion, and the
soft eyes of Miss Grace were fixed upon me.</p>

<p>As I listened to the silvery tones of the fair
orator, I became conscious that I was presenting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
very awkward appearance. My hands seemed to
be as big as the feet of an elephant, and altogether
too large to go into my pockets. I did not know
what to do with them, or where to put them. I
felt like a great clumsy booby. But when the
thought flashed upon me that Miss Grace was looking
at me, and that she must consider me a boorish
cub, I felt the necessity of doing something
to redeem myself. When I was fully conscious that
she was observing me, I quite <ins id='c276' title='original: forget'>forgot</ins> that anybody
else was engaged in a similar occupation. I straightened
up, stiffened the quaking muscles in my frame,
and permitted my cumbrous hands to fall at my
side, just as the professor of elocution in the Wimpleton
Institute had instructed me to do when I
spoke “in public on the stage.”</p>

<p>If the change of attitude produced no effect upon
others, it did in me, for I knew then that I looked
like a civilized boy, and bore myself with the dignity
becoming the young engineer of the Lake Shore
Railroad. Miss Grace handed me the watch, and
I took it with my best bow. She finished her
“neat little speech,” and, as her silvery tones ceased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
I was painfully conscious that something was expected
of me. It was a hard case. Clinging to
the cow-catcher of a locomotive going at thirty
miles an hour was nothing to it. Again I longed
for a hole in the platform through which I might
disappear from the public gaze. But there was no
hole in the platform, and no chance to escape. The
audience were heartily applauding the presentation
speech of Miss Grace; and I think the major was
prouder of her then than he had ever before been
in his life.</p>

<p>While this demonstration was in progress, I tried
to gather up my thoughts for the mighty effort I
was to make. A labored apology, with something
about being in a “tight place,” flashed upon my
mind as a suitable preface to my speech; but I
almost as quickly decided not to make any apology;
for, since no one could suspect me of being
a speech-maker, I was not likely to fall below their
expectations as an orator. Before I had concluded
what I should say, or try to say, the applause
ceased for an instant, and then the Toppletonians
began to shout, “Speech! Speech!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span></p>

<p>If I could run an engine, there was no good
reason why I should not make a speech. I had
something to say, and all I had to do was to say
it. Really it seemed to be the simplest thing in
the world, and I determined to “go in,” however
I might come out of it. In a word, I was resolved
to put it “through by daylight.”</p>

<p>“Miss Grace Toppleton,” I began, and the uttering
of the whole name seemed to afford me a grateful
respite of some fraction of a second in which
to gather up the next idea. “I am very much
obliged to the students of the Toppleton Institute
for this beautiful gift. A gold watch is something
I never expected to have. I didn’t think of anything
of this kind when I came in here, and for
that reason I was very much surprised. I shall
always keep this watch, and, whenever I look at its
face, it will remind me of the generous fellows who
gave it to me. I shall”—</p>

<p>I was interrupted by a burst of rapturous applause
from the students; and while I was waiting
for it to subside, I was satisfied that I was doing
very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>“I shall endeavor, with the help of this watch,
always to be on time; and I hope I shall be able
to do my duty to the officers and to the liberal
patron of the Lake Shore Railroad. Miss Toppleton,
I am very grateful to all the good fellows who
have given me this splendid watch; and though I
don’t believe in wearing two faces, I shall never
look at the face of this watch without thinking of
another face—the face of the one who so prettily
presented it.”</p>

<p>“Good! Good!” shouted the students; and another
round of applause encouraged me in my arduous
task.</p>

<p>“I shall always prize this watch,” I continued,
glancing at the beautiful time-keeper, “for the sake
of those who gave it to me; and I am sure I shall
give it a double value because of the fair hands
from which it passed into my own. With ten
thousand thanks for the beautiful gift, I shall try
to perform my duty better than ever before; and
whatever work is given me to do, I shall put it
through by daylight.”</p>

<p>I made my best bow again, and retired from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
stage amid a storm of applause. As Miss Grace
followed me, I helped her down the steps. The
pleasant, arch smile she bestowed upon me made
me feel that I had not said anything which she
disliked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolf, you are quite a speech-maker,” said
she.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I never did any such thing before,”
I replied, blushing like a little girl.</p>

<p>“You did it real well, Mr. Wolf; and when they
don’t want you to run the engine, you must go to
Congress.”</p>

<p>“If I had only known what was going on, I
should have got ready for it, and shouldn’t have
felt quite so sheepish.”</p>

<p>“That would have spoiled the whole. You did
splendidly. Now let me fasten the chain to your
vest, and see how you look with the watch on.”</p>

<p>She took the watch from my hand, adjusted the
chain in a button-hole of my vest with her own
fair hands, and I could hardly resist the temptation
to do or say something intensely ridiculous; but I
did resist it, and only thanked her as coolly as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
could for the service. Major Toppleton came up
and congratulated me on my speech. I think they
did not expect me to be able to say anything, and
perhaps some of the students would have enjoyed
the scene quite as much if I had broken down
completely. But I am confident that all the compliments
I received were based upon the very
meagre expectations of my intelligent audience.</p>

<p>The students used me very handsomely, and for
the time did not put on any airs. They treated
me as an equal, and even Tommy Toppleton was
as gracious as though I had been the scion of a
great house like his own. Miss Grace walked with
me to the refreshment tables, and while the band,
whose leader seemed to be an awful satirist, wickedly
played, “Hail to the Chief,” I partook of
chicken salad, cake, and ice-cream, being actually
waited upon by the fair oratorical divinity who
had presented me the watch. I was afraid she
would scold me for saying that I should think of
her face whenever I looked at the face of the
watch; but she did not, and I suppose she regarded
the daring expression as a piece of “buncombe”
tolerated by the license of such an occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p>I spent an hour in the most agreeable manner
in the Sandy Beach Grove; indeed, the whole scene
is still a bright spot in my memory. But I was
obliged to return to the dummy, for after all I was
only a poor boy, an employee of the magnate of
Toppleton. I was out of place at the feast and
the revel; but I was very grateful to the students,
and to all the people, especially Miss Grace Toppleton,
who had treated me with such “distinguished
consideration.” I resumed my place on the engine,
and as there were a great many people to convey
back to Middleport, I made quick trips, and literally
succeeded in putting them all “through by daylight.”</p>

<p>After I had put up the dummy for the night, I
went over to Centreport with my father, mother,
and sisters in the major’s sail-boat, which he
placed at my disposal for the purpose. I had never
seen my parents so happy before. If they were
proud of me, I could afford to forgive them for it.
We had almost forgotten that the cloud of misfortune
had ever lowered above us. My father
had not tasted a drop of liquor since the fatal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
day on which he had lost his money, and this was
enough to make us all happy, without any of the
other pleasant events which had gladdened our
hearts. God had been very merciful to us, and
had turned the wrath of man into blessings for
us, and I am sure we were all grateful to him for
his goodness.</p>

<p>Nothing definite had been heard from Christy
Holgate, but it was believed that he had gone to
the South. A close watch was kept upon his family
in Ucayga; for it was supposed that he would
send for them, and it was hoped that their movements
would enable the officer in charge of the
case to ascertain his present residence. My father
despaired of ever hearing from the runaway or the
money, and all agreed that it would be but a poor
satisfaction to have the wretch sent to the state
prison for even a short term.</p>

<p>We walked from the mill wharf up to the house
after I had securely moored the sail-boat. We were
still talking over the pleasant events of the day,
and for the third time I had showed my watch
to my sisters, who were prouder of it than I was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
As we approached the house, I saw Captain Synders
sitting on the fence, and apparently waiting
for the return of my father or myself. I could
not believe that he had any business with me, for
Colonel Wimpleton had paid the honest skipper
for the destruction of his boat, and nothing had
been said for a week about arresting me for taking
part in the mischief.</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for you, Mr. Penniman,” said Synders,
as we went up to the gate.</p>

<p>“I hope you haven’t had to wait long,” replied
my father, gently.</p>

<p>“Long enough,” added the constable, gruffly.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” inquired my father,
rather anxiously, I thought, though his face wore a
good-natured smile.</p>

<p>“Nothing for me, but you can do something for
Colonel Wimpleton.”</p>

<p>“What can I do for him?”</p>

<p>“Pay the note of two thousand dollars which
was due at noon to-day,” continued Synders, maliciously.</p>

<p>“Colonel Wimpleton knows very well that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
money was stolen from me, and that I cannot pay
him,” replied my father.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to him that your money was stolen.
You must pay the note.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Well, we know you didn’t do it, and this afternoon
the colonel foreclosed the mortgage. I’m here
to give you notice of it, and to warn you out of
the house.”</p>

<p>“Does he mean to turn me out to-night?” asked
my father.</p>

<p>“I shall give you legal notice to quit, before witnesses.”</p>

<p>“I will pay rent for the house,” suggested my
father.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” answered Synders, shaking his
head. “The house must be sold after legal notice
has been given; and in my opinion it won’t bring
a dollar over the mortgage, under the hammer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help myself,” added my father,
gloomily.</p>

<p>“You made a bad mistake when you turned upon
the colonel,” sneered the officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t turn upon him; but we will not talk
about that.”</p>

<p>My father was very much depressed at the thought
of losing the thousand dollars which he had invested
in his house. All he had saved was to be swept
away from him. The constable procured his witnesses,
served his legal notices, and went away
chuckling over the misery he left behind him.
Doubtless he exaggerated the confusion and dismay
of my father when he reported his doings to his
employer, and the great man gloated proportionally
over the wreck he was making.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p class='chap-title'>THE AUCTION SALE.</p>


<p class='dropcap'>My father was very unhappy, and my mother
was afraid he would again resort to the cup
for solace in his misfortune. I do not know what
she said to him; but he treated her very tenderly,
and never was a woman more devoted than she
was during this threatening misfortune. My father
was again a poor man. All that he had of worldly
goods was to be stripped from him to satisfy the
malice of his hard creditor. He was too proud to
apply to Major Toppleton for assistance, believing
that he would have nothing to do with property
on the other side of the lake.</p>

<p>I continued to run the dummy, and was so happy
as to keep on the right side of the major, his son,
and the students. Before the expiration of the legal
notice, my father hired a small house in Middleport,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and we moved into it. It was only a hovel, compared
with the neat and comfortable dwelling we
had occupied in Centreport, and the change was
depressing to all the members of the family. My
father’s place was advertised to be sold, and as the
day—which looked like a fatal one to us—drew
near, we were all very sad and nervous. Nothing
had yet been heard of Christy; and the case was a
plain one. The thousand dollars saved from the
earnings of the debtor was to be sacrificed. No
man in Centreport, however much he wanted the
house, would dare to bid upon it.</p>

<p>My father desired to attend the sale, perhaps
hopeful that his presence might induce some friend
of other days to bid a little more for the place. My
mother did not wish to have him attend the auction;
but as he insisted, she desired that I should go with
him. I had no wish to be present at the humiliating
spectacle, or to endure the sneers and the jeers
of the Centreporters; but I decided to go, for my
presence might be some restraint upon my father, if
his misfortunes tempted him to drink again. I
applied to Major Toppleton for leave of absence for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
my father and myself on the day of the sale. My
father had engaged a man to take his place, and
Faxon could now run the dummy.</p>

<p>“What’s going on over there?” asked the major,
after he had consented to the absence of both of us.</p>

<p>“My father’s place is to be sold at auction.
Colonel Wimpleton has foreclosed the mortgage,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“How much has your father paid on the house?”</p>

<p>“He paid a thousand dollars down; and the mortgage
is for two thousand. He would have paid the
note when it was due, but his money was stolen
from him.”</p>

<p>“I remember about that,” added the major, musing.
“Will the place bring enough at auction to
enable your father to get back the thousand dollars
he paid?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; we don’t expect it will bring anything
over the mortgage. Colonel Wimpleton means to
punish my father by ruining him, and none of the
Centreport people will dare to bid on the place.”</p>

<p>He asked me several questions more, and I told
him as well as I could how the matter stood. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
was hoping most earnestly that he would offer to
advance the money to pay off the mortgage; but
just as my expectations reached the highest pitch,
a gentleman interrupted the conversation, and the
major went off with him in a few moments, having
apparently forgotten all about the subject. My
hopes were dashed down. I conveyed all the students
out to Sandy Beach in the dummy that afternoon,
and brought them back; but I was so absorbed
in our family affairs that I hardly knew what I was
doing.</p>

<p>At one o’clock the next day, I went over to Centreport
with father to attend the sale. He was very
nervous, and I was hardly less so. At the appointed
time, a large collection of people gathered around
the house. A red flag was flying on the fence, and
all the company seemed as jovial as if they were
assembled for a picnic, rather than to complete the
ruin of my poor father. Hardly any one spoke to
us; but I saw many who appeared to be talking
about us, and enjoying the misery we experienced
at the prospect of seeing our beloved home pass
into other hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton was there, and so was Waddie.
Both of them seemed to be very happy, and both
of them stared at us as though we had no right
to set foot on the sacred soil of Centreport. Others
imitated their illustrious example, and we were made
as uncomfortable as possible. In our hearing, and
evidently for our benefit, a couple of men discussed
their proposed bids, one declaring that he would go
as high as fifteen dollars, while the other would not
be willing to take the place at so high a figure.
Finally, the colonel, after passing us a dozen times,
halted before my father.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have come over to bid on the
place, Ralph,” said he.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I have nothing to back my bid with,”
replied my father, meekly.</p>

<p>“You had better bid; I don’t think it will bring
more than fifteen or twenty dollars over the mortgage,”
chuckled the magnate.</p>

<p>“It ought to bring fifteen hundred,” added my
father. “I was offered that for it once.”</p>

<p>“You should have taken it. Real estate is very
much depressed in the market.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>

<p>“I should think it was; and I’m afraid Centreport
is going down,” answered my father, with a
faint smile.</p>

<p>“Going down!” exclaimed the great man, stung
by the reflection. “Any other piece of property in
Centreport would sell a hundred per cent. higher
than this.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so!” ejaculated my poor father, fully
understanding the reason why his place was to be
sacrificed.</p>

<p>The auctioneer, who had mounted the steps of
the front door, interrupted the conversation. He
stated that he was about to sell all the right, title,
and interest which Ralph Penniman had in the
estate at twelve o’clock on a certain day, described
the mortgage, and called for a bid.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five cents,” said a colored man in the
crowd.</p>

<p>The audience gave way to a hearty burst of laughter
at the richness of the bid.</p>

<p>“Thirty cents,” added Colonel Wimpleton, as soon
as the noise had subsided.</p>

<p>The auctioneer dwelt on it for a moment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
then the colored man advanced to thirty-one cents.
By this time it was clear to us that these proceedings
were a farce, intended to torment my father.
I had never endured agonies more keen than those
which followed these ridiculous bids, as I became
conscious that my father was the butt of the company’s
derision. The colonel, more liberal than the
negro, went up to thirty-five cents; whereupon the
latter advanced another cent, amid the laughter and
jeers of the assembly. Thus it continued for some
time, the colored man, who had doubtless been
engaged to play his part, going up one cent and
the great man four. Others occasionally bid a cent
or a half-cent more; and half an hour was consumed
in windy eloquence by the auctioneer, and in cent
and half-cent bids, before the offer reached a dollar.</p>

<p>“One dollar and five cents,” said Colonel Wimpleton,
at this point.</p>

<p>“One dollar and six cents,” promptly responded
the negro.</p>

<p>“One dollar and six cents is bid for this very
desirable estate,” added the auctioneer. “Consider,
gentlemen, the value of this property, and the circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
under which it is sold. Every dollar
you bid goes into the pocket of the honest and
hard-working mortgagor.”</p>

<p>“One dollar and ten cents,” said the colonel, as
if moved by this appeal.</p>

<p>“Dollar ’leven,” added the negro.</p>

<p>“Consider, gentlemen, the situation of the unfortunate
man whose interest in this property I am selling.”</p>

<p>“Dollar fifteen,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“Dollar fifteen and a half,” persisted the negro,
amid roars of laughter.</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars,” said some one in the
rear of the crowd, in a loud, clear tone.</p>

<p>If the explosion of the honest skipper’s canal boat,
which had been the indirect cause of the present
gathering, had taken place in the midst of the
crowd, it could not have produced greater amazement
and consternation than the liberal bid of the
gentleman on the outskirts of the assemblage. It
was a bombshell of the first magnitude which burst
upon the hilarious people of Centreport, met, as it
seemed to me, for the sole purpose of sacrificing my
poor father. I recognized the voice of the bidder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span></p>

<p>It was Major Toppleton.</p>

<p>I had not seen him before. I did not know he
was present. I afterwards learned that he arrived
only a moment before he made the bid, and only
had time to perceive the nature of the farce which
was transpiring before he turned it into a tragedy.</p>

<p>“Dollar fifteen and a half,” repeated the auctioneer,
so startled that he chose not to take the astounding
bid of the magnate of Middleport.</p>

<p>“I bid one thousand dollars,” shouted Major Toppleton,
angrily, as he forced his way through the
crowd to the foot of the steps where the auctioneer
stood.</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars is bid,” said the auctioneer,
reluctantly.</p>

<p>I looked at Colonel Wimpleton, who stood near
me. His face was red, and his portly frame quaked
with angry emotions. My father’s property in the
house was saved. We looked at each other, and
smiled our gratitude.</p>

<p>“Toppleton must not have the property,” said
Colonel Wimpleton to his lawyer, who stood next
to him, while his teeth actually grated with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
savage ire which shook his frame. “He will put a
nuisance under my very nose. Eleven hundred,”
gasped the great man of Centreport, with frantic
energy; and he was so furious at the interference
of the major that I do not think he knew what he
was about.</p>

<p>“Twelve hundred,” added Major Toppleton, quietly,
now that this bid had been taken.</p>

<p>“Thirteen,” hoarsely called the colonel.</p>

<p>“Fourteen.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen.”</p>

<p>The crowd stood with their mouths wide open,
waiting the issue with breathless eagerness. The
auctioneer repeated the bids as he would have pronounced
the successive sentences of his own death
warrant. Colonel Wimpleton had by this time forgotten
all about my father, and was intent only on
preventing his great enemy from buying the estate.</p>

<p>“Sixteen,” said the major, who, seeing the torture
he was inflicting upon his malignant rival, was in
excellent humor.</p>

<p>“Seventeen,” promptly responded Colonel Wimpleton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span></p>

<p>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Nineteen,” gasped the colonel.</p>

<p>“Two thousand.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one hundred,” roared the colonel, desperately.</p>

<p>“Twenty-two,” laughed the major.</p>

<p>The colonel was listening to the remonstrance
of his lawyer, and the auctioneer was permitted to
dwell on the last bid for a moment.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three!” shouted the colonel.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three hundred dollars—twenty-three,
twenty-three, twenty-three,” chipped the auctioneer,
with professional formality, when the major did not
instantly follow the last bid. “Going at twenty-three
hundred! Are you all done?”</p>

<p>“Knock it off!” growled the colonel, savagely,
but in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Going at twenty-three hundred—one—two—three—and
gone, to Colonel Wimpleton, at twenty-three
hundred,” added the auctioneer, as he brought
down his hammer for the last time.</p>

<p>“Pretty well sold, after all,” said the major to me,
as he rubbed his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; thanks to you, it is very well sold,” I
replied, running over with joy at the unexpected
termination of the farce.</p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton swore like a pirate. He was
the maddest man on the western continent.</p>

<p>“Colonel, if you are dissatisfied with your bargain,
I shall be happy to take the property at my last
bid,” said the major as he walked out into the
road.</p>

<p>I will not repeat what the great man of Centreport
said in reply, for it was not fit to be set down
on clean, white paper. My father and I crossed the
lake, and went home with the good news to my
mother, who was anxiously waiting to hear the result.
Whatever joy she experienced at the good
fortune of my father, she was too good a woman to
exult over the quarrels of the two great men.</p>

<p>“I think Colonel Wimpleton will not try to punish
me any more,” said my father. “He pays eight
hundred dollars more than I was offered for the
place. If he is satisfied, I am.”</p>

<p>The next day the twenty-three hundred dollars,
less the expenses of the sale, was paid over to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
father. He had already cast longing eyes upon a
beautiful estate on the outskirts of the town of Middleport,
having ten acres of land, with a fine orchard;
but the owner would not sell it for less than five
thousand dollars. The fruit upon the place would
more than pay the interest of the money; and, as
soon as he had received the proceeds of the sale,
he bought the estate, paying two thousand down, and
giving a mortgage for three thousand. We moved
in immediately. The house was even better than
that we had occupied in Centreport, and I assure
the reader, in concluding my story, that we were as
happy as any family need be left at the end of a last
chapter.</p>

<p>Of the Lake Shore Railroad I have much more
to say, in other stories which will follow. The road
was soon completed to Grass Springs, thirteen miles
from Middleport, and I ran the dummy to that
point during the autumn. In due time we had a
regular locomotive and cars, and ran to Ucayga,
where we connected with a great line of railway
between the east and the west. We had a great
deal of trouble with the Wimpletonians, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Centreporters generally, of which something will be
said in my next story—“<span class="smcap">Lightning Express, or
The Rival Academies</span>.”</p>

<p>The Toppletonians continued to treat me very
kindly, and I did my best for them. Our family
troubles appeared to be all ended. My father was
as steady as he had ever been, and though we
heard nothing from Christy, we were on the high
road to prosperity. Miss Grace Toppleton was frequently
a passenger in the dummy, and I must add
that she was always very kind and considerate to
me. I am sure her smile encouraged me to be
good and true, and to be faithful in the discharge
of my duty; or, in other words, to put it <span class="smcap">Through
by Daylight</span>.</p>
